0vz-pTclTiI,"*RTX3080Ti 20GB never made sense...* TechLinked mentioned that ""memory bandwidth is important"" then never made the obvious point as it applies to GAMING. The 20GB version has less bandwidth than the 12GB version (because it's based on 12 chips in parallel for the RTX3090 so the 12GB has 12x1GB and the 20GB would be 10x2GB thus less physical lanes to the GPU). Therefore the GPU would be slightly starved so it would be really difficult to place this in the product stack... it would cost almost as much as an RTX3090 to make unless you cut down the GPU because of defective dies (which would help with the bandwidth issue) but then if your GPU performance was lower than an RTX3080 it's again a big problem in the product stack... not just LOWER performance but highly VARIABLE based on the workload due to the (likely) imbalance between processing power and memory bandwidth. So applications that are LESS memory bandwidth intensive might do better than an RTX3080 but ones that NEED more bandwidth would do worse. That happens with ALL graphics cards but the more the imbalance the more pronounced that is.",0,2021-09-11,2021-09-06

He then sued the government for that and while that occurred was targeted with death threats, race hate, cruel bullying and other awfulness by a pretty shocking cross-section of the Australian community.   Usually there isn't clear evidence for things like this but the videos of his torture were made public and many of the comments were public. This isn't a new decision, the high court upheld a lower courts ruling which was broadly anticipated. He has won these court cases because he is so clearly in the right.

I'd be interested to see how this 20gb card actually performed in games compared to the 12gb version we got.  My assumption is the performance delta would be negligible for most applications / games.

718PVQ3Oty4,"don't care about amd in cars I'll never be able to afford, and I don't care about nvidia releasing lower end product (that's what the used market is for) - I'm waiting for nvidia and amd to release significantly higher end product than the 3090 that I have.  maxed out AAA gaming (cyberpunk, control, shadow of the tomb raider with rtx on and everything maxed out can't break 60fps average at 4k... I'm trying to move to an lg cx or c1 4k 120hz oled soon but if i can't push those pixels it's far less valuable.) also this LHR BS they're into these days is crazy...  right now you can buy a 3080 with about 110ish mh and play pretty much everything OR you can buy a 3080ti which provides about the same performance in gaming but half the hash rate at an msrp that's a few hundred more!? - why would you pay more for them to gimp the performance? smh.  I just wish that these companies would concentrate on pushing the highest end products that they can and then let people who don't want to pay current gen prices buy previous generation product...  gpu manufacturers could save a TON of money (passing that on to consumers) if they got rid of their 5+ gpu model lines and concentrated on just the top one or two (like a 3080 and a 3090) AND continued to produce previous generation models (like a 2080 and 2080ti) LONGER (making them less expensive over time) to appease folks who are looking for more budget options. (and if they did that for a few generations, we'd probably have 2080ti's at the cost of something like a 3060 because they become less expensive to produce over time due to reusing all that tooling, distribution, box art, packing lines, etc. etc. logistics  for a way longer period of time.  it would probably also help iterate because gpu manufacturers engineers don't have to bring out so many different designs and software teams don't have nearly as much product they need to support so QA would be better, etc.",0,2021-06-03,2021-05-31

As for the mining efficiency cap they're trying to introduce on the rtx3060... it'll fail miserably, I give it a week before miners figure out a workaround once the capped drivers are released.  Instead nvidia should've made those mining specific cards wildly more efficient than the current RTX series cards, they should also MASS produce those cards & sell them to actual consumer level miners. The previous run of mining specific cards nvidia made were 99% sold to bigtime mining farms, so barely any of those mining specific cards made in into the hands of regular consumer level miners, hence forcing those miners (and there are alot!) to keep on buying up stocks of regular video cards.. let's hope they learned from their mistakes",0,2021-02-20,2021-02-15

What makes it worse is when people buy from the scalpers which acts as positive reinforcement, so they go back to the drops with their bots and snag up more cards. I'm fairly certain most of the purchases of scalped cards are from miners who are confident they'll ROI rather than a gamer who would invest $2000+ for a 3080 for the sake of gaming. I just want the situation to resolve itself so that gamers can enjoy 1440p/4k with ultra preset graphics and respectable frames.

They wanted to guarantee reclaiming a significant portion of their costs and the rest can go to gamers for even more gain.  Nvidia is in business to make money.

Corporations and politicians are in arrangement of mutual benefitment and ""manually opt-out"" bs is only being adopted by more corporations because corporations are benefitting from it without any repercussions. So more corporations are only going to adopt it in future. In the end, we as people will lose. So we have to not only hold corporations responsible, but hold ourselves responsible before buying and using these ""products""  which really are services. They mine your data in the excuse of improving their services. Educate your politicians, or replace them if they are short-sighted. We have to stop being ignorant.

This fluctuation has enabled bitcoin exchange to become a significant and robust industry. Bitcoin investment is making a lot of people super rich at the moment, but before you can succeed in bitcoin investment you need to work with the right strategies of an experienced broker and trading coach, I started trading with 9OO usd and I have made over 3btc in 2 weeks.. I feel more people need to learn how to liberate themselves from the government, invest in bitcoin, even with as low as 5OO usd you can flip it gradually to a thousand, millions and more.. mY Coach is reachable on whatsapp messenger +19093663156 Mrs Rachel Brooke*",1,2020-12-26,2020-12-21

Due to the fact that a lot of people are not financially stable this period as a result of the recent Covid-19 outbreak, cryptocurrency and Forex seems to be the best alternative for financial backup mostly when it comes to Bitcoin trading  But my advice is for traders not just to invest and trade blindly with the wrong strategy/signals, for me trading has been so profitable because I was guided by a pro trader known as Rachel, with her working strategy/daily signals which turns out to be one of the best out there. During my first month I was able to accumulate and grow my portfolio from 1.1btc to 6.5btc which you will agree is a very good profit, i will advise anyone who is willing to grow a very strong portfolio to make use of Aaron's daily signals.

That's why people who are new in the market always panic daily over the charts, it's a never-ending road if we are being honest. Well as for me, it's always been no pressure ever since I ventured into the crypto community, For me it's been very successful because i was being guided by a PR0 trader called Rachel Brooke whose strategy/daily signals has proven to be so accurate and well analyzed. During my first 5 weeks of trading with Mrs. Rachel's daily signals, i was able to grow my portfolio from 1.1btc to 6.2btc which you will agree is a very good profits mostly as the market is very bullish now.

So it will actually be using a lot less compute power to validate blocks.

So I don't know. I'm no where close to an expert in crypto mining, and certainly not in CPU design. But this is just me best guess at what's going on.

This type of price action often indicates accumulation, which typically takes place at lower prices. The ultra-scarce digital asset would someday replace all of the worlds fiat money and there is little room for in-between scenarios. Bitcoins unrelenting consolidation phase may  last for much longer as the cryptocurrency is beginning to flash some subtle signs of stability as it trades above $17,000 with these factors potentially helping to boost it higher in the days and weeks ahead. I endeavor all traders to look out for the bullish signs in the market and trades with caution under smart supervision.

Might be worth investing a little bit more into it before Elon Musk takes over the world.",0,2020-11-30,2020-11-30
BjRcNFgNo-g,"Linus your a bit misinformed on transporting hydrogen. If a compressed tank of hydrogen is pierced the extremely high pressure forms a dense jet that compresses the air in front of it(remember air is mostly nitrogen not oxygen) mixing inefficiently. This means in the absolute worse case a large jet of flame is created in a single direction, but oxygen can not enter the tank until pressure drops to one atmosphere (15psi) at which point there is a insufficient hydrogen to oxygen ratio available to produce a fuel air explosion. In most situations any small source of ignition(sparks,hot surface, small flames) would be extinguished by the high pressure hydrogen displacing the air. This combined with the fact that hydrogen is a incredibly light element means that it will take less than a minute to clear the accident zone going straight up. Added to this compared to just any other fuel being transport every day like gasoline, diesel, and LPG. Even burning hydrogen does effectively no damage to the environment. Unlike even a simple spill of other fuels let alone a significant fire. The issues with the hindenburg was it was a massive volume of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure perfect conditions to mix efficiently with air. In flammable cloth bags coated in even more flammable sealing compound inside a flammable cloth envelope also coated in even more flammable doping(flexible paint). All on a lightweight aluminum structure with extremely limited resistance to losing structural integrity under extreme heat before also catching on fire. The hindenburg also as most large aircraft do developed a extremely high static electricity charge on external surfaces during long flights. The much vaulted german engineering expertise was mostly the result of massive funding by the german government, and truly obscene level of propaganda also by the german government. Other than the work done in the USA by Wernher von Braun's team it is difficult to find groundbreaking achievements by German engineers. They exist, but the german school of engineering  places a far higher value on improving existing technology instead of developing new technology. This means german engineering rarely leads the world in any field.",0,2020-11-30,2020-11-30

I think hydrogen is not a solution for EVs (bad efficiency compared to BEVs) and main train lines (better use the money to electrify lines) but it can be a good solution in other cases, eg for storage (when renewables produce too much electricity for the needs of the grid) or planes (because of the weight of batteries) or even for train lines with let's say only one train per day. But the stupide sentence was ""humains don't need to breath anyway"" (5:57) because in the new German trains the hydrogen is of course not burned but used to generate electricity (with a fuel cell). So the only ""emission"" is water while diesel trains were emitting many polluting and greenhouse gas. And what is the link with the Hindenburg ? This zeppelin was moved by 4 diesel engines, the hydrogen was not here to be burned. It is as stupid as saying that a forest is bad for air quality and regarding global warming because it can accidently burn. But of course, hydrogen must be produced with renewable energy, the hydrogen used for trains, future zeppelins, rockets, and all the industry.

BjRcNFgNo-g,"I'm no expert so take this comment with a grain of salt, but the comment about the hydrogen train was very misinformed, maybe it was a joke, but what he says is actually not as concerning as you would think, and i'm going to really simplify things to show you why, because, just think for a second, almost everyone in rich countries have a 2 ton piece of metal with a high volatile liquid inside of them, and it can potentially explode with every crash and even after the crash because gasoline is a liquid and it vaporizes slowly creating a total recipe for disaster if any flame is exposed in a large amount of time, but we use it on our cars everyday, and we are mostly good, because the risk is not that high at low speeds, when you go really fast there could be a problem, but i'm not here to talk about that, now let's compare that to a similar product like hydrogen tanks on cars on an accident like that, a usual tank with pressurized hydrogen can go up to 10,000 psi, normal atmospheric pressure is 14 psi or 1 bar, this means that a tank like that would have 689 bar, 689 times the atmospheric pressure which is a lot, that means that when punctured it will instantaneously dissipate in the air, a hydrogen filled balloon will rise up at 20 m/s and without balloon is a tiny fraction faster and that means that within seconds of a crash and if the tank punctures it will release the high pressure hydrogen into the air and it will rise more safely to the atmosphere than in comparison to other fuels available like liquid diesel or gasoline, if it's more safe then why the Hindenburg exploded like that? because they enclosed the hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and then it ignited, in an enclosed place with a puncture and at atmospheric pressure it doesn't have time to dissipate and because the Hindenburg was huge and in the air that hydrogen cannot be released because everyone will die, you have no other option but to see the hydrogen ignite because your ""tank"" is filled with an absurd amount of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, they key argument being that it was ignited after the puncture and slowly got on fire, that cannot happen in more modern times where we don't depend on the flying properties of the hydrogen, but on the electric capabilities of the hydrogen fuel cells, so no, you aren't going to die on a hydrogen powered train, because it just doesn't make any sense, if any train goes off track you should be worried about that and not about the hydrogen, in fact, hydrogen fuel cells are more safe even if they ignite easier than gasoline or diesel.",1,2020-11-28,2020-11-23

BjRcNFgNo-g,"This is bullsh*t; as a miner myself, I don't believe it. Has anyone done the math?  RTX3090 does like 120m/h for ETH, one of the most popular and most profitable GPU coins and costs $1500 USD (and uses ~300w) An Rx570 does 30MH for $100 USD and uses 100w. Four 570s required to get same hash rate as a 3090; costs less than 1/3 AND is 3/4 as efficient; Yes, the 3090 is more power efficient BUT costs $1100 more. You can ROI 4x3090s in about 100 days as compared to over 325 days for 3090. Combine that with the fact that last few gen AMD GPUs spank NV in mining..for example my RTX2060 pulls 32MH and cost me $500 CAD; rx570s cost me $105 CAD and do 32MH. I could believe AMD GPUs being bought up for mining. I do know SOME miners that got 3090s but most got ONE if they were lucky and more for experimentation to see what it can do than to actually buy it to use and ROI off of.",0,2020-11-28,2020-11-23

It doesn't really explode or fireball.  The Hindenburg fire was bad not because of the hydrogen, but because of the materials used to construct the Zeppelin.  Cars and trains running on hydrogen are safer than gas and diesel vehicles.  And while most vehicles don't benefit much from our lack of a hydrogen economy, the few cases where they do make sense are mass transit such as  buses and trains because they run nonstop and they fuel at controlled depots.  We need more clean fuel use in the world.  So please don't spread misinformation and FUD.",1,2020-11-28,2020-11-23

Ironically it might actually end up being a polluter as the process to refine, store, and deliver it isn't very efficient and might actually mean it is creating more pollution overall than using fossil fuels directly.  About the only way it can be truly green is from a solar/wind farm that is built and designed from the ground up just to produce hydrogen.

egop1jwc_Xs,"Sounds like AMD is doing something they done with the x86 architecture. They've extended it to 64 bits, creating the first x86-64 architecture. For those that don't know, the x64 processors are all thanks to AMD, so now seeing them patenting their little.BIG architecture, they might be expanding the already existing architecture this time with elements of ARM. Seeing how APPLE is switching over to ARM, with that architecture being better in mobile devices and their scalability, AMD might want to take that piece of the cake and improve upon it, creating the first x86-64-ARM architecture perhaps? Either way, it is clear that now, once they are dominating the Gaming and Workstation sectors of the CPU market, they are now heavily targeting the mobile sector, with that kind of CPU, if they plan to put it in Notebooks and Laptops, maybe even tablets in the future, we may see these devices have a longer battery life while using normal apps such as the web browser, discord, excel, word etc. while having the performance ready if you want to play games. Something that is a very clear problem in today's ""Gaming Laptops"" is that because of their beefy CPU that they use to sustain 60fps in games, the CPUs TDP is high most of the time, draining the battery even more, So i believe that this architecture of their will not only lower the tdp and increase the battery life of laptops and notebooks but at the same time not suffering as much of a performance hit as you would by putting in a lower tdp CPU.",0,2020-08-11,2020-08-10

For a long while after that mobile GPUs didn't feature anything close to full desktop specs, mobile chips were frequently FAR slower than the desktop versions, so was pretty dope especially at that time.

Sounds like Sony, Ebay, and all those large resellers, who are the Rich, you often hear about, planned an even tigher constriction of the market place from an already artificially tight marketplace.  They are milking the public and using the Pandemic as they do not care, and this is real Anti-Santa Claus individuals and interests who literally are ruining many children's holidays, poor kids mostly. Think about that. What does that say about Sony, Ebay, these resellers, who could have taken steps to avoid this from selling bundles that reduce the profitability of scalping just a console. Also who exactly are these scalpers  I bet if you looked into it you could discover who they are. When you do you are seeing a real life anti-Santa Claus harm the hopes and funs of children.

hnOmghy5B7Y,"I get why people want a PS5 the games are really good but dang is it a bad value for money. Especially the digital edition. The Xbox series X is cheaper than the PS5 digital.. by $20 in the first year and then $120 cheaper every consecutive year.  I hear you go ""But its cheaperz! See Xbox X $499 and PS5Di $399!!"". You are correct in that statement but the ""digital only"" part is kinda important since unlike Xbox the PS5's internet access is not free. It will cost you $10 a month just to connect your all digital PS5 to the internet which pans out to about $120 a year just in internet fee's. That means the PS5Di is actually $520 dollars in the first year and $120 just in internet access fee's every year after it.  That is apart from Sony happily touting the need of $70 titles during an economic recession meanwhile all first party Xbox games will be on gamepass.  Also apart from that you can use your old Xbox controllers or third party controllers that are 1/3th or less than the mandatory $70 you have to pony up to Sony if you want any additional controllers.  Pro-tip: Don't buy the PS5. Yes it will suck because you will miss out on a lot of really good exclusive games but its business model is really screwing you over and Sony is not going to listen to any complaints unless it actually affects their bottom line. So see it as an investment so you can get the same quality of games for a more reasonable price in the future.",1,2020-09-19,2020-09-14

(Then again, he had a kid when he was 15, so how smart could he be? )  1:05 - Yeah, that's normal, there are a lot of fake bids that get retracted, and even if they aren't, eBay will likely cancel a lot of the listings, just like they did with those iPhones that were up for $15,000 or PS4s and such. History repeats.  (Then again, eBay is feckless and incompetent and does nothing about the countless scams on the site, so don't hold your breath. )  1:19 - You can only retract a bid a few times before your account is flagged, throttled, and even suspended.  5:45 - The cops flashed their lights but they were asleep, so they didn't notice.

Hard to turn down free money on my expensive ass gaming PC... but in the Crypto forums there are people with 10-20x RTX 3080s and 3070s and it makes me sick. nVidia really needs to get a handle on this. The issue isn't the guy who buys one card, plays games, but turns on the miner when he sleeps, it's the people with dozens of cards (and ESPECIALLY the scalpers, who are only able to sell cards because of miners). Stop the scalpers and your problem is 90% solved. They won't stop the miners. There's too much money on the line, and the miners are usually tech savvy enough to find a way around it. It would only stop people like me who do it passively on my gaming PC. The stores need to do a better job gatekeeping, and nVidia could enforce it.",0,2021-03-04,2021-03-01

So if I'm understanding this, the 3060 saga has gone like this for Nvidia: Nvidia reserves a likely significant portion of their very limited available silicon exclusively for miners Nvidia uses this silicon to make mining cards with no display outputs, making it difficult nigh-impossible for gamers to use the cards Nvidia announces that the remaining gaming cards will have a multipart lock that reduces their usefulness to miners by ~50% Miners now have dedicated silicon and reduced utility on other hardware; gamers now have ""dedicated silicon"" (that miners _can_ still use) and a portion of silicon locked off to them at a hardware level Nvidia doesn't actually put a proper lock on the gaming cards; cards can still be used to mine with no penalty Miners now have full utility on all Nvidia cards plus a dedicated inventory allocation during a silicon shortage; gamers now lose access to that inventory and gain absolutely nothing in return  That is such a massive backfire on Nvidia's part that I can only assume it was intentional.",0,2021-02-25,2021-02-22

Why did I buy anthem?  Trailer blew me away  I enjoyed the Open beta,  Yes I enjoyed it, played for 6hrs in 48hr open beta.  Enjoyed the combat and flight in the game (there's literally no other game like it on pc).   After purchase Yeah the story was shitty  Yeah loot grind was shitty.  Dropped the game  It's been 19 months since I last played it.  Was really hoping it to get fixed cause combat and movement just felt too good.   2 years after game release, 23 months since I bought it.   Anthem is dead My hopes have been killed.  Why?  Pc gaming sucks  Moving to ps5 for single player exclusives  Never gonna play multiplayer  I'm done with these so called AAA game publishers  If it's online focused screw it.   Seeing as I haven't bought more than 2 games and I won't be buying any way game until it has good reviews 5 months after release.   Now tell me am I an idiot?",1,2021-02-25,2021-02-22

She seems like the rare cool and nerdy gamer girl that everyone loves. So I will enjoy your videos more with her since the effeminate guy stuff was getting a little too much for me.

HZigkcTxRo0,"I was so sad to hear about Frys! I spent a lot of time and money there in my late teens and twenties. Loved all the different themes. The one in my hometown was kind of computer history themed. Mayan one was pretty cool, Egyptian and Western themed ones were kinda ridiculous, Californians World Fair theme one was bad ass with the huge Jacobs ladder inside, and the Railroad history themed one in the Sacramento area was pretty cool as well. But I wont miss their horrible inventory tracking and control.

HZigkcTxRo0,"Important part of the Aus news story, our media is heavily controlled by Murdoch and the 7/9 network. The whole thing was mostly Murdoch trying to get money out of FB and Google, which the government helped them with by threatening to make it law. (Current right wing government is deep in bed with Murdoch who supports them in return for being allowed to decide a lot of policy, and 9's head is actually a former minister of the party in government so yay).  Technically I think the laws still going though, but with a big loophole saying ""if they come to their own agreement it doesn't matter"". Something like 90% of the money is going to the two networks I mentioned above.  So one group of billionaires pays another group of billionaires money. Both beat their chests about how important they are, and the public benefits not at all from any of it.",0,2021-03-01,2021-03-01

As of now(1:50am gmt+3) it's at 1.129m views, making it #7 top video on the channel, within spitting distance(5 and 17k, PFFT) of #5(1.146) and #6(1,134). Got a bit more than half a mil views to go, I expect it to kind of lose steam exponentially, hence the two weeks, we'll see. Won't be readjusting my estimate, it's not a fair game that way :) EDDI3: 3.3.21, 4:57am gmt+3 - #5, 1,214m views EDI4H: 4.3.21, #4 PIA5: as of 5.3.21, it's 40k before #3(shown at #5 atm) Edit 6, final: 11.3, two weeks since posting, 1.345M, #3.

This magnetic sister likely allows sharing it off sideways, which for me and a visually identical magnetic connector probably put +12V (quick charge) on what's supposed to be GND and GND on a data pin. That phone's USB data pin circuitry is so fried, that it doesn't even recognize any charger anymore. It only trickle charges in the mode the hardware uses to recover from zero remaining charge and being turned off.  There is a different layout with 5 pins staggered in two rows, similar to a serial port connector, which is sensitive about the direction (like microUSB, not fancy USB-C) but doesn't stuffed from the shearing issue.",0,2021-03-16,2021-03-15

HZigkcTxRo0,"You've got to hand it to Madison: She knows how to handle a program well; her sense of direction is not one that we see much on the online front and the impact that she delivers is not one that must ever be taken for granted, she is a keeper in any form of material and this is a perfect example of what she truly is capable of. Watching this episode of Techlinked made me feel more as if I were watching a segment of WGBH's I999 reboot of ZOOM, and that is an extremely good thing for me to say: For the uninformed, ZOOM served as an Anthology~style program for WGBH from I972 to 2006 that focused on a plethora of original concepts and practices; their monologue bits were always the ones that stood out extremely well, and Madison single~handedly managed to revive this template that we haven't seen on television since the series went out of Syndication in Massachusetts in 2007 (though an online~based successor to their ZOOM into Action segment would later launch in 20I9, with the I999 reboot's Pablo at the helm); Madison's sense of direction and character is exactly what I expect out of Public Television, and to finally see that be brought to Center Stage on a High Profile media group's channel on YouTube is something that was ultimately way too long overdue, she will go far in this industry the more that she gets to present her production formula to the general populace and this will open the door for other PBS and WGBH~style producers to do in kind down the road in the best ways possible.

Or face fines of either $10M or 10% of annual turnover. This mickey mouse law is comical - and, yet, here it is in reality, where yet another niche segment of society(""journalism"") is put on some unearned pedestal because we can't let go of doing shit the way we did it in the 1900s. At some point, maybe the media should evolve with the times, like they have in the past up to this point. FB & Google putting shitty newspapers that no one reads out of business sounds like a whole lot of ""not my problem"", get gud or whatever like 'the kids' say...    While everyone is busy celebrating anything negative happening to Google & FB, don't forget that the media that this law is propping up(even though the industry in its current form clearly needs to be allowed to die off or evolve into something that actually works within the 21st century without stealing everyone else's money to keep them on life support) doesn't give a damn about you, is LITERALLY owned by corporations on Google & FB's level(guys, we're talking about ""poor wittle News Corp"" getting a cut of FB's & Google's pie because ""they could never compete with them"" - yea, News Corp, because they're definitely on the verge of , bankruptcy...), who are putting out deliberately biased news because, hey, that's the audiences they've cultivated because that's the only ""news"" that they've managed to pedal today. We're talking about organization used by governments to manipulate you; and this isn't even conspiracy theory shit. Yea, not sure why the fuck we're supposed to feel sorry for them.   Oh, but this law isn't about the News Corps of the world - it's about the independent journalists! ...except that there's no language in this regulation that actually makes sure that the money is invested back into the media organizations... ...you know, instead of just going straight to executive bonuses, because there's zero teeth in this regulation to actually police what the media is doing with the money.

The NVIDEA CMP cards have much better hash rates, and their performance hash / watt power consumption is far better than GPUs. Because there is always so much demand for NVIDEA GPU cards, there is not the same markup on the CMP cards making them an even more attractive alternative. People need to understand that just because someone mined $7 per day on a RTX 3600 doesn't mean miners wouldn't buy a comparable priced CMP card that mines $10 dollars at a portion of the power consumption.

Some people are ignorant of profitability investment  I started trade with my husband 4years back initially we lost almost all of our money on it but later on when a friend of yours introduced to Paul Sanders & co he made us understand what crypto is all about and how to invest and make it big we worked with them they trade for us the whole money we lose back then all are recovered and we make a very big profit now so dont be scared to invest on what can make your future brighter you can contact them on WhatsApp on+1 240 203 8227 to know more about,0,2021-02-25,2021-02-22

From a libertarian perspective, I support Facebook's move to have blocked all news content instead of bending to authoritarian legislation meant to determine the flow of money according to the government's opinion on who ""desserves"" it. The free market has infinite room for negotiation, and any linking fee must've been privately negotiated; the news companies could've easily vowed to take it to the courts instead to argue that people reading titles, previews or other contents of news articles, Facebook was committing an IP violation. That could lead to private, consensual negotiations.  ""Socialism is like rape; capitalism is like consensual sex.""",0,2021-02-25,2021-02-22

l1B-xsSeoCM,"Miners? Don't you mean bot scalpers? Miners are also victims along with gamers, software engineers, content creators, and data scientists of the x3 prices caused by bot scalping enablement.. If miners were taking all the GPUs they would not be on ebay/offer up/amazon/newegg marketplace at all, they'd be in a rig MINING. There are so many deep learning and Ai developers with available  software to combat scalping that isn't being used by e-commerce because at the end of the day regardless of bot or human these e-commerce spots are still getting the money. Bottomline is to make physical stores like best buy, microcenter, etc have the majority of supply and send the few to e-commerce, until e-commerce takes scalping serious enough to take action. Bots dominate internet shopping, the bot is faster than the hand. But a bot cannot wait in line at a physical location, at least not yet so best to make physical locations carry the majority supply until then. But this whole crap on miners thing is just silly, miners would have their GPUs in rigs not on the market. And until e-commerce does something about scalpers its assumed that its an e-commerce inside job to take advantage of demand and prey on comsumers.",1,2021-01-01,2020-12-28

lEwZTNQCxYQ,"I think the 2060 re-release deserved a bit more elaboration. 2060 is an older process node, meaning that it's not going to be made on the same process as the current GPUs. In a nutshell, Nvidia was clearly able to buy additional manufacturing capacity on an older node. So it's not a case of them coming up with some random bullshit, but using literally whatever manufacturing capacity they can get.  The fact that Nvidia has resorted to an older process node makes it brutally clear that the shortage is going to last throughout 2022. And them going for 2060, which is going to have a very high yield, suggests they will be aiming to maintain market share rather than just maximising profits. Which also suggests they're probably taking Intel's entry to the GPU market seriously.",0,2021-09-15,2021-09-13

And in terms of ""bad performance increase, not worth it"", the card still slays through everything at 1440p ultra.  Point is, it's preferable to buy a 3000 card, even one that online reviewers (who get it for free) try to bury it; as long as in your specific budget situation and market conditions it's a good deal, then you should go for it.

Further, while I don't think having last gen's card still available is necessarily a bad idea, it makes me wonder how it would compare to a lower-spec 30-series card.  I don't see the point of having two pieces of hardware with neck-in-neck performance, or two cards with barely distinguishable price points.  So, if the 2060 isn't _significantly_ cheaper than a 3060, then I don't see the point in a 2060; and if the 3060 isn't _significantly_ faster than a 2060, I don't see the point in a 3060.  We could probably stand to have fewer SKUs.  2060, 3060, 3070, 3080, 3080Ti, 3090 ... that's too many cards.

lEwZTNQCxYQ,"Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't buy a 3090, but I had to because it was only $200 off MSRP, while 3080's are usually priced double (sometimes triple) to their actual price. And I was only able to buy it because the store that it sells from is a store that is not well known for selling gaming or computer related stuff. Meaning not a lot of people are botting the website (like Amazon, Newegg, and Bestbuy), but nonetheless, the stock was gone in less than 15 secs after I got one.  Edit: yeah, 3080's, especially non LHR ones are still highly desired because at MSRP, it would only take around 3-4 months to pay its price off by crypto-mining, while 3090s will take about a year or more. This is why 3080 prices can go up to triple, and why AMD cards are cheaper is because they don't mine as well as Nvidia cards.",1,2021-09-14,2021-09-13

nl1tZx9knzA,"I know I'm going to get flack for saying this but I remember when steam first came along and the market was just saturated with game disc's in stores. Each game had its own way to work, run, and save games back when I was younger consoles had an easy way for me to manage my save games and move them with memory cards. Games back in the early 2000s on pcs often times didn't have this or they had glitchy bugs built into the disk (fallout tactics) that you simply couldn't get a fix for. Heck some games back then even screwed up your machine when they installed forcing you to reinstall your OS and try again. After steam came a long and they started curating games they also started forcing developers to use their installation systems to avoid installation errors and so games could be patched then they forced them to start making sure it could save games to both steam cloud and a local directory. I finally could game and not worry about some system glitch or update or installation error and losing my saves. I try and see both sides of this narrative 30% is a lot but I don't want to go back to those days where we had major issues just even installing a game.

Have you tried playing in EPIC? Try playing Overcooked with your controller... you can't just play it like in steam, at least when I tried it last year.  Their stores are not as smooth as Steam.  The case with Valve is not same as Apple case. In case of Apple, you can't sideload so your only choice to download ""Fortnite"" is from App Store.  But in Steam Case, People can choose to use Microsoft Store, Epic, or anything else. But both the developers and the gamers choose not to do that.  The gamers want a big library so they do not need to use a lot of clients, easy to manage, controller support, and mirror play.  The developers want the sweet money from the Player Base, they can choose to put it in Steam, Epic, and Microsoft at the same time. But they realize that Steam still generating more revenues.  So.. lowering the cut for the transaction to 12% instead of 30% is making sense.  Which one will you choose? Get more money but low volume of purchase or less money but high volume of purchase?

nl1tZx9knzA,"GPU Limiters: The only thing I care about is that a manufacturer is essentially telling customers what they can and cannot do with the hardware they purchased. That's a big no no in my book. The rest of it doesn't matter as it's not like anybody is going to be able to get the GPUs for MSRP anyway.  Apple vs Epic: The stage is set and place your bets. I would be happy if Epic wins, but my bet is on Apple coming out the victor. Apple is just too powerful with the laws being written as they are now. Laws are going to need a major overhaul to do something about Apple and other big tech companies. I would be surprised (and happy)  if Epic wins this case.  Valve sued: For all the other online stores out there, Microsoft Store, Epic, PlayStation's store, Nintendo's store, etc., I just don't see Humble Bundle winning this one yet. Maybe if I knew about about it I could see their chances, but at a glance I don't.  ISPs sue New York...I used to live in that state and the state does what the state wants. This is also the state that blocked the Spectrum merger within its borders because the cable company didn't hold up their end of the deal and expand their coverage to reach people who had no access to broadband. This one can go 50/50 IMO since ISPs are extremely powerful and it's basically the clash of the titans going on in that state. I left the state for my own reasons, but this is one case I'm hoping NY wins. The ISPs need to be taken down a peg or three and it's high time government starts fighting back against them. Their reign of holding us back with crappy service and unchecked monopolies in many areas needs to be challenged and defeated.  Voice chat recording: .......Seriously? They haven't ALREADY been doing this? With all the data recording companies do on people, I'm genuinely surprised this isn't already a regular thing.  Roku losing the Youtube app: Meh, not like I ever had a desire to use it on a TV anyway. The content on Youtube has never been something I'd want to want on a TV. It's always been PC and mobile for watching Youtube for me. As for the privacy concerns...vigilante companies don't often do well when they stand up to Google alone. Roku will never be able to prove Google is abusing their power as they slowly lose visibility to new customers. Instead, they need to band together, come up with a way to defeat Google, or lobby the government to crack down on big tech or both.  Solar roof price hike: I wouldn't be surprised if the issues surrounding the chip shortage has something to do with it outside of Ellon Musk needing a new summer home on his own island.  Robo dog dropped by NYD: They came, they saw, they tried. Nothing beats real police dogs that everyone loves unless they're getting chased by one.",0,2021-05-01,2021-04-26

It'd be expensive but I'd rather see Apple go back to PowerPC. PowerPC has different features that can benefit the personal computing space in some really unique ways if a smart engineer can get on it and figure it out. Things like 4 threads per core and CPUs that have a normal clock rate of 5GHz can make some really different and interesting builds for the tasks you need to run and when you step outside of office work, school work, gaming, and streaming 'educational material',  you'd be surprised what people use their computers for.",0,2020-06-11,2020-06-08

And half as ray tracing ?  lol No thank you.  Sure 3xxx will be heck faster. As will be the Canadian $$$$$ price when they do drop.  Consider most ppl dont have jobs thanks covid 19.  As for intel cpu and another flaw found? hah was any doubt? sure AMD isnt perfect either.  But still more secure then intel. I am Happy with 2700x.  It be interesting if ARM at some point become main cpu everybody use?  And anybody who O/c their system is already running out of spec from AMD or intel. Lol. If get 3-5 yrs out it.  Your doing good.  I got 4+ yrs out my old i7 3770k 3.5 GHz. Before upgrade 2700x. Will keep old i7 as back  up pc/server pc. Will prob give my old i5 4690 somebody who does not own good pc.

pZo0r45xxC0,If nvidia raises prices again and l cant get a 3080 for 600 uk pounds...then they lose a customer. I will get a console instead and wait on rdna3. Nvidia getting to greedy and prices are ridiculous now. Rumors are they bringing in a 3090 to...thats just so they can price it at last gens ti prices and make ti even more expensive. Also l see very few; n tech raising the question of how much of the performance gain of these new cards is based on the extra power they use and heat produced. The 3090 and certainly the ti version may well cost three to four times the price of new consoles...l mean come on..l love tech but seriously its time to stop buying them otherwise buying a gpu in a few years time will be as expensive as buying a car. I went from a 1070 ..sold it got a 2070..useless upgrade hardly any difference...sold 2070 ..got 2080 super..only because with sale of 2070 only cost 300. Again ..faster now than 1070 but still limited memory and still unable to do very high to ultra settings at 2k nvm 4k. At end of day its   a 600 pound plus ca d that cant do raytracing with acceptable fps and isnt a massive upgrafe from 1070 even. So if you have a card to sell fair enough..but if prices go up again ..l give up.  I would rather spend on a top tv and console and wait for gpu prices to come down. Ive always had nvidia cards but as the prices go stupidly high had enough.,1,2020-08-01,2020-07-27

pZo0r45xxC0,"I predict that Apple's transition to ARM will result in differentiation between PRO products and consumer products.  PRO products will continue to use x86 processors while consumer products will use ARM. It's the difference between rendering large audio/video projects and support for all of the plugins involved and a complete lack of support. Remember, the audio/video industry has a history of MAC support as a standard. If that standard no longer works, nobody is going to support Apple in that industry. Besides, all of the reasons that Apple became a major player in that industry have become null/void in the last 10 years anyhow. So what if Apple is going ARM? They might as well try something new and make the best of it. Because they have been dominated by their competition in the areas they used to dominate.

QUv6h0eFCjg,"Linus! you could make a video about the actual real problem with the budget relation between the price of a good PC and the price of a competent monitor for it. Because as I had to experience while building mine, I've seen that actually by buying a 1000$ PC requires to buy a 400$ monitor just to run without making any bottleneck. Yes, I'm talking about decent VA/IPS panels at 1440p at 144/240Hz.  Maybe a video showing the real cost of a full setup (or at least the components that could make a bottleneck like pc and monitor). And find the sweet spot for either 1080p at 144/240Hz, 1440p at 144/240Hz and well... 4K at 60Hz? That video could help everyone a LOT to choose between a real good 1080p experience and a 1440p experience without messing up by getting a beast PC and a sh*tty monitor.  And then maybe you could send it to me if you thought this was a good idea ;3  Hope you could read this comment at least, I like all your videos, explanations and ""expensive-drops"".",0,2020-12-07,2020-12-07

AFTER THAT you go to your checkout screen where you have to select a store to pick up this card that YOU ORDERED ONLINE, and of course the only three stores within 250miles of me was out of stock in about 1 second.

QUv6h0eFCjg,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I detect a rounding error. The 3060 Ti in a broad range of games is 21% faster than the 5700XT in rasterization at 1440p high-ultra, and 28% faster at 4K (Source: Hardware Unboxed, 3060 Ti Review, conclusion section), at which resolution its 8 GB frame buffer is ill-suited in my opinion. Since the 5700XT does not support ray tracing, rasterization comparisons are those where percentages matter, and there is no metric representing an objective average by which the 5700XT is 30% slower than the 3060 Ti. The inverse of 21% faster is 17-18% slower (not 30%!) at 1440p; the inverse of 28% faster is 21-22% slower (not 30%!) at 4K. Should the actual price of a 5700XT you can buy undercut the price of a 3060 Ti by more than $100 or so, their cost per frame is equivalent or favorable to the older Radeon GPU. If, on the other hand, you could get a decently-built 3060 Ti for around $400, that _would be_ an expected generational price-to-performance improvement versus the 5700 XT, and no better than expected for a card released 16 months later.

t4TbEqKmdPc,I would say I'm sorry to see Shadow in the situation it is but I've tried their service.... It was awful not only did I get horrible performance in games I also had horrible lag and stutter if I ran anything in fullscreen so I had to run shadow in windowed mode with a windowed game. I only got around 50fps on GTA online 1080p very high versus my 1660 super which gives me 70-80fps.... Which the Shadow GPU is supposed to be a 1080 ti equivalent but I call BS unless I was being forced to share a GPU which they claim doesn't happen. Regardless though even overlooking the performance issues the bugs were problem enough to just not even consider it. That's why I bought the prebuilt on sale instead of sticking with shadow and I am glad I did not sign up for a year that's for sure because I was considering it.  Don't get me wrong I'm sure it will get better with time but currently it just feels like a beta product and I feel like a beta tester that's paying for the service... I'm just not for it not for the performance it gives plus now I have a prebuilt and even though the Shadow PC allegedly has better specs my PC outperforms it by far.,0,2021-03-11,2021-03-08

t4TbEqKmdPc,"To whom it may concern, Apple does not track you across third-party apps and websites. All the warning asks is that users give consent for apps to track them across third party (other developers') apps and websites. So the warning only applies to apps which behave strictly more invasively than Apple does. App developers do not have to ask user consent to be tracked inside their own apps, but Apple does a pretty good job of warning users when they track you inside Apple apps also, holding themselves to a higher standard than that to which they hold developers on their platform. Does anyone actually informed about this see it differently? Because Rene Ritchie has already debunked this one over and over.  So in answer to your somewhat joking question, Riley, if you use iPhone and Safari with an internet provider other than T-Mobile, you don't get tracked across apps and websites by Apple, or Google, or T-Mobile, but likely by whoever your internet provider is unless you use a VPN. I use Private Internet Access. You heard of it?  I am alarmed when this show talks about Apple and privacy and lumps Apple in with companies whose business model it is to track you without your knowledge. Apple makes their money when you pay for their products and services. They've continually pushed for better privacy practices across the industry, and this show, along with the rest of YouTube, would do well to recognize that. Contributing to misinformation about privacy, even through jest, is beneath you all.",0,2021-03-11,2021-03-08

Someone at MSI made a small mistake, thus Starlit Partner, a subsidiary of MSI that handles dead stock, refurbished/open-box items, etc for them and sells it on eBay, got their hands on some of the new cards, and figured it would look good on their report if they sold them on eBay for a ridiculously high price. When MSI realised, they stopped it, apologized, and offered compensation in the form of partial or full refunds to the customers who bought the cards on eBay.

I say this as someone who Kickstarted the game a while ago and doesn't play it because I kickstarted for the single player game. ...and YES I am getting sick of Squadron 42 being pushed back again and again but please direct the anger/mocking/etc to where it belongs.,0,2020-10-13,2020-10-12

Maybe that's the reason why low volume of Ampere cards, low yield of 8nm Samsung or it's too subpar for nvidia's standard seeing it clocks worse than Turing  Also for Epic case, not the temporary money they are seeking, but platform dominance and control. On Android side, they can't really make a case since sideloading and alternative service framework are a thing on Android for years. Heck, Android used to have black market app that you can install apk+obb, basically free paid games and apps and Google doesn't really care since they screwed it through GMS anyway with Play Protect and SafetyNet. I used to welcome Epic for bringing another Steam competitor but harvesting my Steam data, making Rocket League Epic-only and later making timed exclusive releases, I lost my respect.

Better make sure you wife does not look very young, or have smooth skin, or just comed back from spa.... so the algo do not think you got pictures with naked kids in your phone;  4) And Most important: Phones are word wide sold.

u1Qn_KHM1GY,"If it was only searching for hashes, it wouldn't need machine learning.  Hash comparisons only need the device to go ""here is a hash of a new file"" then the server queries the database to see if it is a match.   Machine learning means they are training the software to find files that look ""similar to"" illegal files. Which means your phone could see a series of pictures of your petite girlfriend and say ""this looks similar to a child"" and flag your device on apple's servers.  Then Apple will either invade your privacy and have employees look at your girlfriend/ wife's private pictures (which has resulted in them leaking those pictures when Apple repair techs got into devices) or just waste police resources by sending detectives to your house blind.  Either way you look at it. They are illegally invading the privacy of every single one of their customers, to disincentivize the less than 1% of people who might use their device to hold illicit media from purchasing or using Apple products.   Not even to punish those people, as the only ones they'll catch like this are the low hanging fruit flirting with kids on sites like Facebook, that police can already find with ease. All this does is drive away privacy conscious people who don't want a corporation to have uncontrollable access to their phones.

But when people start to affect others by e.g uploading stuff, commenting etc, everybody about them regarding the data they uploaded should be public. People should be able to see who wrote a certain comment, who they are, where they life and how to contact them. People could be made responsible for the harm they create and also for the good they do. In RL, people aren't anonymous when they affect others too. It would save so many lifes by preventing bullying. And regarding the ammount of pubblic data, it would also prevent others from abusing it.

u1Qn_KHM1GY,"The apple thing does not surprise me. The USA gov't must have some leverage or favor on Mr. Cook, the board or Apple's plans.  The US Gov't ""theoretically"" is restrained by the law, and due process. It is known the gov't often asks private entities who are not under such restraint and can ""weather"" lawsuits to do ""favors"" for the government. It's a known secret that the USA's ""national security/law enforcement/intelligence community"" regularly asks the USA's allies (UK) to look at data that has been collected and send back the results.    Another example of this was Bestbuy's Geek Squad was unbeknownst to consumers actively working with Law Enforcement via their bounty program.  The whole Bestbuy thing could have been avoided by not actively participating, as it incentivized the planting of evidence for money. Simply posting a sign and a blurb on the service contract that says: ""If we find illegal material as defined under USA law it will be reported to law enforcement with or without your consent."" I inform my patrons orally and in writing before I even look at their machines.  Using the ""Save the Children or think about the children"" argument is an emotional argument and a way to make people feel good about not thinking about the consequences. I recall when ""for the children"" was the justification in the 1990s when Federal Law Enforcement in Waco TX, wanted to use a tank, and burned said children alive*.  ""for the children"".  I am all for getting rid of child Frackers, but do it correctly and leaglly so they can be put away instead of walk free on technicalities and due process violations.   *Even if law enforcement didn't start the fire, their behavior and handling of the situation was a big contributor to a fire being started as most cult leaders never want to die alone.",0,2021-08-07,2021-08-02

u1Qn_KHM1GY,"I think Linus needs to double check that first Apple story because it sounds like some of the facts got a bit jumbled up. Machine Learning will be used to scan message attachments for sexually explicit content. If the Neural Network determines that the attachment probably contains sexually explicit material, it will blur-out the content and provide a warning that stating that the image is most likely, sexually explicit.  Now, as for the child pornography thing, that doesn't require any Machine Learning. That is nothing more than a hash-key value check, something that databases have been doing for years. Normally, even the smallest modification to the image will result in a wildly different hash, but Apple is claiming that their hashing algorithm can get around some image manipulation. Legit online database storage services already do CSAM database checks.   Two things are changing here. First, like I mentioned before Apple is claiming that small modification to the image will still result in the same hash-key, and the naming convention that they're using for this does imply that their algorithm might partially ML based. How they managed to do the training for this ML does raise some ethical issues because the only way to know if it works on images that contain CSAM is by running images that contain CSAM though it. You can't really do that without having CSAM database of images (not to be confused with a database of image-hashes) in your possession. You can do small image manipulations to images that don't contain CSAM material and use that as a training base, and this will result in something that probably works. Because it would be a bit like how they do feature detection for image recognition of people's faces. As long as the generated features are the same for the manipulated image and the original image bur are different for other images that are similar, then they can probably has the features instead of the image. But, probably works is not the same as, we know it works. The only way to truly know that it works is to run it through an actually database of known CSAM images. Also, if they are using a NN the way that I think they are using an NN, then I already have a few ideas for creating false positives.  So, we don't know how well this new hashing algorithm works. And, if someone has child porn that isn't in the CSAM database, then this database check won't do anything because that child porn isn't in the CSAM database.  The second thing that is changing is that the hash database check is being moved to the user's phone. This is where privacy issues start to kick in. Apple will be checking people's phones for known content that is unwanted by someone else. When it comes to CSAM content, I think that's a good thing. Yet, that known content will be found by checking a database that can be switched out for a different database. I will repeat, the database can be switched out for a different database. So, instead of checking for known images that contain CSAM, Apple can check for known images that contain Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh, creating a list of people for the Chinese government  to detain. Or, a database of image hashes for the Star of David can be used, to identify potential Jewish people. Or, a hash database of known depictions of Allah can be used, to create a list of people to have flogged in public. Apple might not be able to see most of the content that is on your phone, but they can see your phone contains forbidden content.",0,2021-08-07,2021-08-02

The people behind this absolutely do not care about ChildP, they care about introducing total Orwellian control beyond even the imagination of majority.  Like who would be using their phones to ChildP after this announcement? I would assume these rings use some sort of encrypted networks, darknet, TOR, etc. for distribution, and thus computers.  I certainly am not defending CP watchers, but that's not the problem. Those that do the material are the problem, those that r@p minors are the problem. And nothing is being done onto that, except trying to effing normalize p3d0s through countless efforts.  This sort of privacy invasion cause harm to whistleblowers etc. more than those p3d0s that these whistleblowers are exposing. The whole system is thoroughly corrupt when it comes to this. As Stanley Kubrick said ""the world is run by secret societies that are connected into secrecy as they are p3dos"".  The true handful of people who run the show keeps it all together by having their vaults full of videos about all the leaders doing these dirty deeds. Almost no one gets high on the ladder without participating in that activity.  It's too creepy and awful that people just cannot accept it, and instead it's easier to just ignore it and call the people as theorists, even though there's God knows how many victims exposing directly the people who used them.

u2UGqLvq0_k,"as someone who has worked in the franchise industry - need to correct you about the 10 labor hours to use phrase....  in the manner you spoke that, it is a management phrase.  If that is the exact phrasing they used, then what that ACTUALLY means is that General Manager of the store will have 10 additional labor hours budgeted to his store for Black Friday weekend.  IOW, its far worse than what you said - its not that they are allowing some poor schmuck(s) to get 10 hours of pay... thats a small sliver of it...  instead, this is a company ACTUALLY having its management team members DANCE like monkeys, for the PRIVILEGE of not having to kill themselves/short staff their stores to hit their labor targets for that weekend.   10 hours is an extra body on staff for what i would assume would be 2 heavy rush periods of 5 hours each, or 2 extra peeps for 5 hours for a really killer rush.  from what ive heard of GS, most likely they just work managers only (no other in-store hourly help) 90% of the time unless its a 3 billion dollar unit.  im applying my knowledge of the food industry here, but again IF THE PHRASING IS CORRECT, im 99% certain im correct (or essentially so, at any rate)   awarding stuff like that to GMs isnt necessarily bad in and of itself, but this is PEANUT shit in the grand scheme - its the fact they are making motherfuckers DANCE to just be able to BREATH DURING A GD SHIFT during the busiest time of the year?  i mean, ive heard the horror stories of this place, and i stopped shopping here eons ago, but im reminded quite clearly that:  .

u2UGqLvq0_k,"I understood when you guys dipped a bit into American politics with the China ban because there are a lot of Chinese tech companies, and don't get me wrong I love you guys at Linus Media Group, but I hate it when you talk about Trump when it has nothing to do with tech, ESPECIALLY when you are wrong. Trump claimed that they are cheating by counting ballots that were handed in *after* the polls closed. In addition to that Republican observers were kept out of the voting centers in Michigan, Clerks were giving voters sharpies instead of pens and then threw away Trump votes, and denied permission to add surveillance in Nevada to make sure it was done fairly. Trump was also dominating in Michigan when overnight Biden received 180k votes which were handed in after the polls closed. So in the end Trump never claimed that counting absentee votes is cheating but adding in votes after election day ended. As someone who loves LMG please listen to your viewers and talk less about Trump unless it directly has to do with tech. And I say viewers as in plural because I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.",1,2020-11-05,2020-11-02

u2UGqLvq0_k,"um, I disagree with the gpu market analysis.  nvidia is still at the top of the gpu market with the 3080 and 3090.  AMD is relatively similar in terms of non-ray traced gaming performance, but nvidia still leads with their proprietary hardware and software with RTX (I believe still fastest ray tracing), dlss (doesn't seem to be an equivalent yet for amd), and tensor cores for accelerating AI based applications, and most folks who have software that does GPU compute (including but not limited to video editing software, traditional 3d workstation software like blender, etc. uses CUDA and those that also use opencl isn't as well supported or as performant in those modes...  also the video encoder on nvidia (nvenc) is way better looking than the amd equivalent... it's more expensive, but if you want the best, it's still the 3080/3090. - BUT if you don't care about ray tracing, dlss, or compute at all, (which i'm sure there's a pretty big swathe of gamers who fall into this group) the amd options are looking really good... especially for performance per dollar.  also, I would venture a guess that amd might actually have better stock on their cards than nvidia, and being able to get them in hand is likely to be a decisive factor in buying decisions for the first few months after amd's releases...  I've had the money and wanted to buy a 3090 since they were ""released"" - but NO retailers have the cards for which I'm happy to exchange my money... to the point where I may even end up buying a 6900xt to hold me over until I can get my hands on a 3090 - particularly with cyberpunk coming up, and wanting to play control at something more than 40fps max on my 2080ti, and with my hp reverb g2 about to ship...",0,2020-11-05,2020-11-02

XOeBnGirfKc,"RICO (the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) is not as commonly used or even applicable, as many may be led to believe. Racketeering at its inception referred to repeat- or circular schemes of extortion, but its understood legal reference today is much broader.  The core concept of applying the RICO act, is to enable law enforcement to take down criminal and corrupt organizations, companies etc, by charging _everyone_ in it with the crimes committed by _any_ of its members. This tool is particularly useful for taking down high-ups and leaders in such organizations, which is almost always extremely difficult by traditional means - because of technical and personell layers of obfuscation and separation, making it incredibly difficult to pin a serious crime to them directly. By using RICO, they cast a _very_ wide, tight and heavy net over the entire operation, usually creating too many pressure points for the organization to be able to counteract with threats, intimidation, bribery/corruption, violence etc. And by the time any word of the current law enforcement strategy (building an actual RICO case) leaks out or is publicised, investigators and DAs have usually been surveilling, gathering evidence and extensive signed/recorded witness statements, and built strong cases for a big volume of crimes committed by multiple members of the organization, for _years_ already. So when law enforcement make their big raid(s), it's too late for the organization to make any major impact through intimidation of or violence against witnesses and other key actors.",0,2021-03-16,2021-03-15

XOeBnGirfKc,That beta driver for the 3060 is useless for miners. It only works if you're only mining with a single 3060 but with multiple gpu's the hashrate goes back to being halved. So if you buy a 3060 for you're gaming rig then mine away but if you're buying 3060's for your farm then the limiter will still be active. So Nvidia still accomplished their goal of miners not buying up all the 3060's.... for now.,21,2021-03-16,2021-03-15

XOeBnGirfKc,Does a mining card need the tensor or ray tracing cores? Dealing with the contention between miners and gamers seems like it needs dedicated hardware that matches the hash rates of an equivalent gaming GPU for a lower price.  One way to potentially deal with the e-waste issue could be to allow those CUDA cores to get teamed up with the ones on the GPU somehow. I think all the building blocks are there but it would take pressure for Nvidia to do the engineering to make it work reasonably well.

Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because; crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late. While looking at the growth rate of cryptocurrency and the opportunity it present. why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now. Get an expert like Katelyn ejmont who traded for me. with her strategy of trading you can make up to 0.90BTC = $45,000.

I hope they take my advice and start a pre-order system that allows Ryzen 5k owners to enter their serial key to get priority purchase on gpus.

YqR-klyztC0,"""Have you even held a bit coin"" How you going to buy something in a power cut... or When the infrastructure is so run down and inflation so rampant that fixing  power grid makes it not viable.  Yep, worlds shaping up for electronic cash only. Its cheaper, not costs in transporting or converting it or staffing to exchange it.  All online.  But here's the kicker folks. Me being old school. I use cash there splat there it is.   No worrying did my partner use the money in that account to pay bills early for a discount. No extra transaction fee's Its not money im using that i don't have to spend. like you would from a debit card and then pay interest back on. Real cash is one of the easiest ways to save, you see every dollar you spend as it pass's through your hands. No easy payment method click add to carts and oh its gone at the end of the month did i really spend that much..  Moreover When that Eftpos is out, as I've seen happen in the last several Christmas's and even a Easter, guess who skips the queue of people waiting who only brought their card with them..   Shopping at those times at the busiest times is stressful enough as it is.  You cant even get money out to pay that parking fee to exit the car park lol.    Me no problems, straight to the front of the q ALL get what i need and out.  Wow you mean you wrote all this tldr stuff to explain how having real cash saved you a few times.  No i wrote it cos when everything is electronic and cash isn't in society, that you will be woefully dependant on others and those others constraints, be it infrastructure or legal. It wont matter how much you have over there or in this or in that. If you don't have it on you to trade for whatever it is you need or want, that currencies availability relies on others, then youre not in control of your purchasing power or any given situation, which could happen at any second.  Imagine if the Eftpos gets hacked it loses millions per minute. Block chains work from processing transactions best as i can find out, the wiki is really most vague and many miners dont even know, I HAVE ASKED 7 of THEM, all they see is more more more free money mine mine or trade trade, and they get down right shitty and persnickety when asked.  Even streamers are all like aww but but no we give trading advice here..  Sir you don't know who's funding at the base level of that trade!   How can you trade which is much predictive as anything..  You don't know what your trading with.   You know what your trading but not from who funds it or how there funds are.   Can have 50 trillion whatever. IT DOESNT matter if the source cant back that up.   or If its locked up in legal or method of transfer.  Trading a finite amount of an infinite resource hmm ok.  When you try to have a decent conversation and ask, who is behind paying and fund the crypto coins.   Not the providers that throw on the transaction fees and allow access for money any given various crypto currencies.   But the $ about who pays for the cash that goes towards mining at the block chain level.  Where does there money come from.   Names and numbers, where is their cash coming from. None could answer and these were seasoned second gen miners, as in boom bust survivors.   There's no I can look up their financial history, their profit and loss % business mission statement even. That there is a red flag. If you're working for a business and you want to take out a big loan, you want to know you can pay it off and so does the lender..  But how do you know that,  if you dont know whom you work for and what their prospects and income is.   Its nothing but air. may as well call them Air Coins and Fatih coin and Im going to throw cash at something i have 0 information about its financial status, other than the faith that others put in it...",0,2021-03-10,2021-03-08

I can make $1000/day if I buy out all the mining GPUs, or I can make $1500/day if I buy out all the mining GPUs AND the regular GPUs. Why would I not do that?  I mean, I wouldn't personally because I am poor and can't afford to buy ANY GPUs but the point stands, miners are too incentivised to buy every GPU they can get their hands on, putting out more chips will not change that.

And though the miners bought up the cards anyway, it's likely due to lack of alternative stock.  Still, even the announcement has slowed it down.  There is no legal basis to restrict sales to just gamers.  There's no constitutional protection, and Big Red has walked back the previous promise.  I'm expecting the flood of new stock to delay them even more because they'll have even more options.  Those who care about others, and don't want to burn the time and money on mods, are probably just going to buy the new cards and leave some gaming cards for other people.

YqR-klyztC0,"I'm building my first mining rig now. I would not even _consider_ buying a mining card. They have _no_ resale value. I'm buying everything on ebay. I plan to sell everything on ebay eventually. Mining difficulty is always increasing, and old cards fall below the power efficiency threshold that would be needed to mine profitably. Then I need to know that I can resell my hardware to gamers. A mining card won't cost much less upfront but would always become e-waste soon, worthless to everyone, especially gamers.  Also, I'm a gamer more than a miner. Even if I didn't plan to build a mining rig, I'd want to keep mining on my laptop. I only got into crypto because I could mine it on my laptop with a GTX 1060. I want to keep mining to help pay for my next laptop to be better. The main thing Nvidia's Ethash limiter on the 3060 accomplishes is breaking the cycle for ordinary gamers who mine cryptocurrency with their one graphics card. Also, it will hurt the resale value of the cards when gamers sell them, if it even works. Any miner crafty enough to break the pseudo-DRM will be able to resell a 3060 to other miners for more money than a gamer ever can ever sell their stock 3060 for.  What a horrible new era. Cryptocurrency designers design their cryptocurrencies explicitly to be ASIC-resistant and keep control out of the hands of any mining companies or specialized manufacturers and in the hands of hobbyists and gamers, and Nvidia and AMD are both actively fighting this effort just to possibly sell more. Power to the gamers. AMD is still doing pretty well by us because it isn't pretending that crypto-limiting a mainstream card is a good idea, but both companies are making cards that they know are useless to gamers and want us to assume they have the best intentions. They don't. Miners, don't buy a mining card, Gamers, don't buy the 3060. An even better GPU from either company could mine ethereum or vertcoin for a few hours each night while you sleep and easily pay for the difference between the 3060 and the better GPU. Let your hardware work for you, and send a message that you don't want to give up that ability. Vertcoin is designed to be minable in the background without slowing down your computer, so you might even be able to mine that during the day, though I haven't tried it.",0,2021-03-09,2021-03-08

But i gurantee there are alot of people who'd pay good money for a good 1080p card like an RX 580 8GB What I''d like AMD to do, is bring vega over to GloFo 12nm, its not like AMD didnt already do the majority of the leg work. All of the 3000 series APUs have Vega on GloFo 12nm, cut out the CPU cores, and you've got a ~Vega1.5, with 35-40CUs, maybe make it the same 495mm of the vega 64, Maybe 80CUs, with a bit lower power consumtions and higher clock speeds. Give it GDDR5/6 instead of HBM2. Chage $250-350 for it (MSRP) as a 12nm vega64 will likely slot in somewhere between the 5600xt and 5700 in performance, and being on 12nm, there would be plenty of wafer capacity, and a VERY mature node means yeilds should be quite high  Not for miners, but for everyone.",0,2021-03-09,2021-03-08

Or, c: they actually are releasing a titan this generation, which is more about the driver support at this point as opposed to the performance bump, but then a titan was only a tad bit better then the xx80ti's of previous generations and only made sense if you were a professional anyway, which would 'justify' the inevitable $2500 price tag, I think that's about the original msrp of the last titan.
