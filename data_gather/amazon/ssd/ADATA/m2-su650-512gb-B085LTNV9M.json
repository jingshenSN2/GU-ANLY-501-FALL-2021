It delivers read/write performance of up to 550/510MB/s and greater reliability than 2D NAND SSDs. The SU650 sports SLC caching and advanced LDPC ECC technology to ensure optimized performance and data integrity. Upgrade with 3D NAND. It's a No Brainer! With 3D NAND Flash, the SU650 M.2 2280 SSD features higher efficiency and increased reliability compared to 2D NAND SSDs, as well as higher capacities of up to 480GB. No matter using it for work or as a boot drive or storage device for your PC, you'll revel in enhanced performance. Enjoy Boosted Performance An intelligent SLC caching algorithm allows the NAND Flash memory to operate in single-level cell mode. This boosts performance, helping sustain peak read/write speeds of up to 550/510MB per second for smoother and faster boot, file transfers, and downloads. Advanced LDPC ECC Technology With the support for LDPC (Low Density Parity Check Code) ECC technology, the SU650 M.2 2280 can detect and fix errors to ensure data integrity and help to extend SSD lifespan Its MTBF (mean time between failures) is up to 2 million hours or 25% more than 2D NAND SSDs. Great for Desktops and Notebooks The SU650 is ideal for desktop and notebook PCs. Whatâ€™s more, it is easy to install so you can immediately experience improved performance. SSD Toolbox and Migration Utility With the purchase of the SU650, you qualify to download ADATA's proprietary Toolbox and Migration Utility software. It's the perfect tool to help you monitor and manage the SU650 with information pertaining to drive status, wear level, and lifespan. The Migration Utility is especially helpful for users making the move from HDD to SSD, as it is designed for simple and quick backup and migration of the contents of entire drives, including the operating system.","promotions":null,"newPriceIsMAP":false,"coupon":null,"availabilityAmazon":-1,"listedSince":4826880,"fbaFees":{"storageFee":-1,"storageFeeTax":-1,"pickAndPackFee":270,"pickAndPackFeeTax":-1},"variations":[{"asin":"B07V1KHPKK","attributes":[{"dimension":"Size","value":"120GB"}]},{"asin":"B07TYGQJ45","attributes":[{"dimension":"Size","value":"240GB"}]},{"asin":"B09FYHSX9P","attributes":[{"dimension":"Size","value":"256GB"}]},{"asin":"B085LTNV9M","attributes":[{"dimension":"Size","value":"480GB"}]},{"asin":"B09FYGWF7V","attributes":[{"dimension":"Size","value":"512GB"}]}],"itemHeight":0,"itemLength":0,"itemWidth":0,"itemWeight":0,"salesRankReference":-1,"salesRanks":{"1292116011":[5626932,477,5628964,807,5629064,867,5629738,935,5631392,1105,5631728,1104,5632766,1214,5632808,1207,5633208,1241,5635720,1298,5635922,1292,5636232,1307,5636678,1327,5637852,511,5638800,671,5638916,725,5640024,413,5640532,622,5641374,436,5642144,626,5642428,704,5642828,715,5643016,724,5647348,1095,5647404,1098,5647714,1132,5650198,1229,5653100,593,5653706,475,5654016,529,5654388,353,5654636,396,5654816,472,5655064,619,5655372,405,5656080,348,5656136,392,5656502,311,5656592,310,5656678,311,5657240,423,5657800,495,5657984,541,5658108,583,5658230,620,5659606,368,5661598,536,5661732,556,5663202,750,5663412,751,5664032,478,5666208,593,5666540,277,5667048,380,5667296,422,5668228,377,5668354,421,5668988,467,5670456,529,5670580,730,5670916,778,5671280,820,5671630,831,5672122,884,5674964,258,5677760,615,5680732,572,5681134,732,5682266,826,5683386,921,5686108,1073,5686926,1092,5687196,1101,5688660,1121,5689436,1111,5692096,1216,5694564,705,5695224,854,5695352,890,5695816,936,5696040,948,5696384,955,5696646,1006,5697170,1034,5697736,413,5698490,639,5698800,672,5699434,770,5700440,938,5701028,1009,5702144,633,5702244,630,5704118,979,5711112,1306,5715032,1420,5717836,1471,5721926,1532,5722244,1519]},"salesRankReferenceHistory":null,"launchpad":false,"isB2B":false,"stats":null,"offersSuccessful":false,"g":1101,"categoryTree":[{"catId":172282,"name":"Electronics"},{"catId":541966,"name":"Computers & Accessories"},{"catId":1292110011,"name":"Data Storage"},{"catId":1292116011,"name":"Internal Solid State Drives"}]}]}
