1,-1,0vz-pTclTiI, rtx3080ti 20gb never made sense techlinked mentioned that memory bandwidth is important then never made the obvious point as it applies to gaming the 20gb version has less bandwidth than the 12gb version because it's based on 12 chips in parallel for the rtx3090 so the 12gb has 12x1gb and the 20gb would be 10x2gb thus less physical lanes to the gpu therefore the gpu would be slightly starved so it would be really difficult to place this in the product stack it would cost almost as much as an rtx3090 to make unless you cut down the gpu because of defective dies which would help with the bandwidth issue but then if your gpu performance was lower than an rtx3080 it's again a big problem in the product stack not just lower performance but highly variable based on the workload due to the likely imbalance between processing power and memory bandwidth so applications that are less memory bandwidth intensive might do better than an rtx3080 but ones that need more bandwidth would do worse that happens with all graphics cards but the more the imbalance the more pronounced that is ,0,2021-09-11,2021-09-06

2,-1,41srowy8QJw, honestly in re amd what i'm hoping for is an a320 b350 x370 situation technically speaking you weren't supposed to be able to put a ryzen 300 desktop processor into a 300 series board but i have a gigabyte a320 over there that says proudly on its box that this isn't how things work i'm cautiously optimistic that support for 400 desktop in 400 series motherboards will be on a similarly oem by oem basis not that this hurts me directly i wasn't planning to upgrade my cpu anytime soon anyways so really amd is doing what amd has always done with the am4 platform it just has bad optics because of the way they're saying it that and waiting so damn long to drop b550 so that people like me who don't need x570 features had no choice but to buy the older and now at least partially dead end b450 ,0,2020-05-09,2020-05-04

2,-1,41srowy8QJw, i recently built one and knew i had better go with a 570 because almost all the reviews and details online showed that 450s are frequently not compatible out of the box with the higher 300 series chips requiring bios to be updated which could require an old ryzen chip to do in the first place supposedly amd even has a loaner program for people to get an older chip to allow them to update bios for 450 boards anyone who saw that when picking parts and said it's fine i'm sure that despite 450 barely being supported with current gen chips it will somehow be supported fully with next gen and if you are already a gen behind on your cpu then suck it up if they kept things compatible for more generations to allow people to save money it will also limit advancement of the technology ,0,2020-05-09,2020-05-04
2,-1,41srowy8QJw, wait what b450 won't support ryzen 4k series cpus then why did videocardz report this url i'm asking because i and three of my friends intend to build rigs based on the recently launched msi b450 carbon pro max wifi r5 2600 and 2x8gb 3600 ram with the intention to upgrade to ryzen 400 cpus in a couple of years we were initially looking at the msi b450 tomahawk max when i discovered the press release for the newer mobo why would msi release a max version of the b450 pro carbon so close relatively speaking to b550 chipset and ryzen 400 launches surely it isn't unreasonable to expect msi's max refresh and refreshes from other mobo makers when ryzen 300 launched to be compatible with ryzen 400 since these will be the last am4 processors including ryzen 400 apus ryzen 400 is supposed to offer decent ipc gains over ryzen 300 and both the tomahawk max and pro carbon max wifi offer over 4133mhz ram support so why can't these two models and other updated refreshed ones support ryzen 400 why limit it to just x570 and b550 based mobos only this is pretty disappointing from amd i have to say really disappointing it really feels like amd is inflicting an intel on loyal customers minus the socket change which actually makes it worse ,0,2020-05-09,2020-05-04

5,-1,BM9TrKki2X4, from what we have been shown so far these cards look really impressive and i'm super excited that amd can finally compete at all tiers once again it appears that these amd cards offer more performance per dollar than nvidia's already pretty decently priced 300 series so again this is great the one thing i worry about for amd cards though is dlss i know there aren't many games using dlss just yet but the number of titles that will use it will is only going to increase with time and these amd cards won't come anywhere near the performance of nvidia's cards when dlss is enabled so we have to really hope amd does have an answer to this technologies but personally i would have thought if they did have something they would have announced it at this event so unless amd does have a killer dlss tech they are holding back for some reason then the choice of which card to go for comes down to which games are most important to you nvidia will have a massive performance per dollar advantage in any game that uses dlss so if any of the games are important to you then i think nvidia wins easily unless amd hurries up and announces their version of dlss control death standing cyberpunk 2077 call of duty black ops cold war fortnite f1 2020 minecraft wolfenstein youngblood metro exodus battlefield v shadow of the tomb raider final fantasy xv anthem bright memory mechwarrior v mercenaries deliver us the moon monster hunter world more games will be continually added amd needs an answer to dlss ,0,2020-10-29,2020-10-26

2,-1,dWS_62In89A, linus tolvald explains that the reason why intel looks like a cheese apparently abused the speculative performance to increase performance at the expense of security and all that to beat athlon and phenom at the time the funny thing is that if we review a little of its history this seems quite normal see the case with pentium where its more expensive model was 30 slower than an athlon with half the price and up to 40 slower than the most expensive athlon so to sell them they went on to bribe the oems and sabotage the compilers that worked with amd sometimes i have to wonder if intel is as innovative as they say only that intel leaves core and makes a new architecture will be saved from this and surely there are many more because intel knew this fault for months and was informed to 7 months when by rule is given maximum 3 months and then made public apparently did not intend to make it public at some point and still now try to minimize the seriousness of the vulnerability with bribes to researchers url ,0,2019-05-17,2019-05-13

1,-1,H8aCHU0egl8, there could be instances where turning on ray tracing in a game will actually increase your fps normally you're calcualting the scene and also the ambient occlusion and cube maps and shit all with your normal rasterization gpu but if you turn on the ray tracing then all of the lighting calculations will be moved over to the rt core part of the card freeing up the rasterization part to be faster when turned off the tr core will be doing nothing at all which is a waste which is why you shouldn't buy these cards yet imo in practice this could theoretically mean an increase in fps with ray tracing on though this assumes that the ray tracing can keep up i'm speaking theoretically here another positive thing about all of this is that you no longer need light maps and cube maps textures in memory as those are pointless if you have ray tracing this means games could be smaller in size and use less vram ,0,2018-08-21,2018-08-20

5,-1,lqAVld7USxs, lol that's cute 8k xbone sigh every generation of the xbox since 360 bragged about being able to game at specific resolution and then reality hit it's never that resolution xbox 360 claimed hd rez gaming reality 360p or 480p at best and that still depending on the game dev and if he programmed the game to support that resolution and still most often 30 fps xbone claimed full hd gaming reality most often still 480 or 720p and when it was 720p it was falsely scaled to that and still dependent on if the game dev built the game to support that rez still most often at 30 fps xbone x the key detail of course is that the xbox one x and earlier xbox one consoles will all be able to play the same games but titles that are x optimized will be able to take full advantage of the one x's 4k resolution yes the one s is capable of 4k and hdr output for videos and 4k blu rays but only hdr for games quote url reality again at the mercy of game devs who over 90 of the time developed built the damn games this time finally at real full hd 1080p with some games falsely scaled to 1440p resolution and still many games gimped at 30fps facepalm meanwhile the pcmr has been able to do all of these things at higher fps in most games at least 2 year or more before the damn newest next gen conslow even launched i've said it many times and i'll state it again there are many reasons why it is called the pc master race and not the conslow copies pc years later race the damn video games are built using the pc it is asinine to keep pouring resources into a dead end market dead in involving the context of real value across the board and not just gimped gaming and a gimped monetarily sandpitted market of gaming experience the conslow has been trying to become the pc for now more than 15 years since at least the first gen sony playstation btw and yet it still cannot do the following 1 game at true uhd and 4k as well as in greater than 30 let alone the 60 fps that the pcmr has been able to do for the past 2 years since the launching of gtx 1080 1080ti and even the 1070 with most even demanding aa titles with a few settings dialed back a little 2 rip transcode shrink movies 3 edit documents pictures music and video 4 enjoyed a complete not gimped internet usage experience email web browsing downloading anything from anywhere and also using torrenting software testing other operating systems be it native or using a vm etc 5 the ability to truly repair components as well as upgrade every component in the system when we want and sometimes even how we want small form factor build pc's with pci flexible riser cards nice invention for example and thus not to have hope microshit or phony aka sony will fix our machine we paid for if it has a stupid critical functionality bug like the damn ring of death on the 360's sony had a bug or two as crimpling for a while also 6 the ability to play all classic games dating back to even the 1980's nintendo era and snes to gensis and dreamcast n64 gamecube and wii xbox 360 and even xbone as well as playstation gen's 1 2 3 some say even the 4th gen via emultion some specific arcade games via the mame emulator multiple arcade machine emulator to play games like virtual fighter from the win 95 and 98 days what classic games that didn't work natively for win 7 or newer windows operation systems vm's allowed to use of such as madden 2003 versus windows and newer shrugs shoulders thus across any or all of these options even exclusive titles such as zelda metroid ninja gaiden gran turismo didn't and cannot stop the pcmr from being able to enjoy them without the stupid expense of having to buy every conslow to play each exclusive title 7 mods god modes level editing etc in games the pcmr is the only place to be able to do all of these 100 doom games of all generations are just a few of these examples versus their conslow adaptations i could go on with at least 3 more examples of useful things that the pcmr can do that conslows can't or best case can't do well worth a shit but hopefully you get the point facts don't care about your feelings the only reason to buy a conslow is just for nostalgia and exclusive titles in which that version of the conslow doesn't yet have an emulator for available even game menu and level loading times have become much much slower over the decades and you're still having to download things like updates and in game content just like a pc game depending on the game so that advantage of speed of jumping right into game is basically dead from years ago verus the days of nes genesis and snes and even then depending on the game mortal kombat 1 for example there were credit screens to wait through stop giving your money to the conslow world among steam gog now linux is really taking off in terms of gaming capabilities and lutris there is simply no excuse to buy a conslow unless the exclusive game or two that you absolutely must have doesn't have an emulator for it it's that simple chris titus tech level1techs forums hell ask me sincerely and i try to help i've been slowly migrating to linux for a big chunk of time and it's almost there for me i'm picky i'm hoping some of my origin games will finally start working as they should they are the only ones in my aa modern day titles that don't quite work yet as of the last time i tried

4,-1,lqAVld7USxs, me personally i think that 8k and the 120 hz will be for video format only like movies and stuff but it won't be in gaining that's for sure the nest thing i want to raise my opinion on is that they don't want to mess up like they did with xbox and ps4 and they certainly don't want another mid gen upgrade from business prospective it's the best thing to do but then when that happens people will end up forking out that 1k for a decent gaming computer instead because that's the most sensible thing to do i mean why pay 500 for a console thats going to be a nightmare with optimization only to fork out another 500 in 2 3 years you rather pay 1k or even abit extra for a good computer that will last you about 4 years atleast and the performance will also be better than what console has to offer honestly my cousin spent k on his computer 5 years ago and all he upgraded recently was the gpu which cost him no more than 200 not even a penny more and mind you it's will going strong infact no bullshit here it's running forza horizon 4 at the highest settings possible with not a single frame rate dip now that's an investment because not only is it for game but everything else too it's just stupid to spend 1k for below standard performance so the point here is that sony and microsoft are pulling out all the cards here and going for it now that google stadia is capable of 10 teraflops and has standard 4k 60 sony and microsoft need to bring the best to the table and i for one have got a feeling that they may be charging 600 for their consoles ,0,2019-06-15,2019-06-10

2,-1,MfI9QDxvyAU, so we can more or less to a certain degree at least prove that nvidia a rigging the market and have been for years anyone would assume using the economic laws of supply and demand that if a supplier had had 300 00 of a product returned to them because somebody got it wrong with regard to the crypto mining boom that you would see a decrease in prices of that and related products hmm funny it has not happened then or if it has then it has been pence rather than pounds that alone to me at least proves that nvidia have just been controlling and rigging the market for years they continually over hype their products all the time and if you have one that is more than a week old then somehow you are a loser because you do not have the latest and purportedly the greatest nvidia products are banned from being sold in our shop because they do not offer a very good deal for traders we simply refuse to stock any of their stuff we are however quite interested in seeing what intel do when they enter the graphics card market even if they are employing amd's staff to do it amd give a much better deal a lesson from history is the graphics card company called matrox remember them the reason they failed is because their products could not live up to the hype generated about their cards i guess some folk at the time shilled a bit to much and the gaming community went off them because they were just not that good despite what was said and published about them at the time here's a video all about what happened it might just be possible that the same thing will happen to nvidia when folk just stop buying from them or their partners url ,0,2018-07-13,2018-07-09

4,-1,nl1tZx9knzA, i know i'm going to get flack for saying this but i remember when steam first came along and the market was just saturated with game disc's in stores each game had its own way to work run and save games back when i was younger consoles had an easy way for me to manage my save games and move them with memory cards games back in the early 200s on pcs often times didn't have this or they had glitchy bugs built into the disk fallout tactics that you simply couldn't get a fix for heck some games back then even screwed up your machine when they installed forcing you to reinstall your os and try again after steam came a long and they started curating games they also started forcing developers to use their installation systems to avoid installation errors and so games could be patched then they forced them to start making sure it could save games to both steam cloud and a local directory i finally could game and not worry about some system glitch or update or installation error and losing my saves i try and see both sides of this narrative 30 is a lot but i don't want to go back to those days where we had major issues just even installing a game remember games that required windows live activation ugh it was terrible no thanks ill stick to the steam store also i'm not giving up my workshop mods so sorry microsoft store epic figure it out ,0,2021-05-14,2021-05-10

2,-1,OYJ-Ve2eOwo, i don't think the change from x86 to arm from apple will have the ripple effect some seems to think in the history of apple computers apple used powerpc architecture for a really long time before making the change to x86 yet at the time pcs were already on x86 for a full decade imo amd and intel are still set for a long time as arm processors catch up to x86 although arm processors have made pretty good leaps in the last 5 years their progress seems to have slowed quite a bit the changes are no longer as radical from generation to generation ,0,2020-07-17,2020-07-13
2,-1,OYJ-Ve2eOwo, so the threadripper being an oem only thing do you think it's because they're only able to making so many at this time that they need some special motherboard specs settings to work that well and or due to some quid pro quo thing maybe we'll get more high end amd laptops a combination of some or all options or something else entirely i have no idea why he thinks that microsoft needs to follow apples switch to arm besides haven't they had arm versions of windows for years now partly because he didn't really give any good imo reasons but also consider everything on windows based on x86 and x64 it might work for a company with as much control over their platform as apple has but i can't see windows going fully over to arm this decade uninformed guess i can see them spending more time and money on getting windows for arm better though edit same with both intel and amd can't see them having to try to make arm processors or leaving x86 64 as they have quite a bit going for them for quite some time ,0,2020-07-16,2020-07-13

have a clone of you they can do this kill your real body by either applying a constant electrical current to your clone or by torturing your clone your real body will die from a heart attack or an aneurysm the same day or the next day they are victimizing people all around the world while theyre asleep some people dont recall anything that takes place and some people think the experience is a dream or a nightmare additionally theyre deceiving people by making them believe that their experience was a lucid dream or just a regular dream or a nightmare or astral projection or an obe aka an out of body experience they tell people different things e g that they're in the astral plane 4th dimension 5th dimension etc it depends on the person and what they are more likely to believe lucid dreaming and astral projection both take place at the cloning centers in this dimension they use clones mk ultra and drugs to manipulate and deceive you youre not having a lucid dream and youre not in another dimension or in the astral plane in your astral body youre a clone at the cloning centers in this dimension most likely in a mk ultra scenario the clones at the cloning centers have a microchip called mindvoice also known as artificial telepathy or mk audio effects implanted in their head so they can use mk ultra visual and audio effects on you and to control you with the use of this chip they can make anyone see or hear anything you can even feel and see yourself floating flying shooting fireballs etc but its all an illusion known as mk ultra visualizations that only you can see the people in control know what youre seeing though and other people that theyre using mk ultra on may be able to see as well they put people in whats called a mk ultra scenario which is basically a controlled experience at the cloning centers using mk ultra visual and audio effects and drugs for example someone flying around fighting monsters theyre in a mk ultra scenario they do this mk ultra scenarios for entertainment e g sit back and laugh at the person because they look like an idiot running around doing whatever to test them i e to see what one does or how they react in certain situations and to influence the person real body in real life e g make them feel a certain way about someone or whatever like increasing the likelihood of a girl wanting to go out with someone lets say that theres this old man that wants to have sex with this pretty girl at the cloning centers they can put a mk ultra visual effect of some celebrity face that she would most likely be attracted to over this ugly old mans face so that shed be willing to have sex with him they use drugs in addition to mk ultra to help with the manipulation one may be pre drugged prior to clone activation transfer of ones consciousness to a clone and or drugged during the experience one may even find themselves in the same area or room where their real body was sleeping or meditating at this is not a dream or a lucid dream and you didnt project or go out of body you are simply seeing mk ultra visuals or illusions at the cloning centers as a clone youre in a mk ultra scenario when one sells their soul it means that they agreed for the illuminati to use a clone of them at the cloning centers for sex or whatever while they're asleep in exchange for fame and fortune in addition some have sold out and joined the illuminati even youtubers and twitch streamers to receive benefits at the cloning centers e g being able to have sex with celebrities as clones and or benefits in real life e g money and fame vril type 1 lizards terrestrial aliens are parasitic carnivorous and malevolent theyre about one to two feet tall their head resembles the body of a king crab and their body is covered in red diamond shaped scales they dwell underground theyre dumb and are able to talk but smarter when they turn a human into a host drone they have a proboscis called the quill which is located on the top of their head the proboscis which looks like a chocolate chip contains everything that the lizard is its consciousness their lizard body is dead once the proboscis leaves its body they can only do this once in their lifetime and if they fail turning a human into a host they die the human that is about to be bodysnatched is either unconscious or restrained the proboscis enters the humans eye and spirals around the optic nerve it then proceeds to go to an area of the brain driven by taste that tastes like butterscotch to them then they do a feeling of holding your breath and pushing outwards finally it does what's called sweating the quill at the tip of the proboscis which excretes the parasitic cells that take over the human body this kills the human and replaces their consciousness with the vril lizards consciousness the vril lizard becomes that human after about a months recovery time this transition from vril lizard to human is whats called droning once a vril lizard becomes a human they are then known as a drone host of vril or a parasited host a person that has had this happen to them may be referred to as someone that had been possessed by a demon this is what demonic possession is in addition some hosts of vril drones call themselves walk ins in which they describe how an alien consciousness or soul took over their body the slit eye videos that you see all over the web are fake the illuminati put these out intentionally to mislead everyone into thinking that one can tell who is a reptilian vril lizard and a host of vril aka drone by checking to see if their eyes turn to slits this doesnt occur and they cannot do this however the eyes are one way to tell sometimes there may be an eye that pops outward or inward due to the droning process or it makes the eye stray so it looks like the person is cockeyed or walleyed there is no shape shifting either the so called shape shifting is the transition from vril lizard to human those that talk about reptilian shape shifters are referring to vril and people who have been droned drones parasited hosts of vril mimic human behavior they are willing slaves with no compassion and only care about droning other people torture and sex theyre murderers they killed the human to use their body and live life as them as a human the soulstone also known as a consciousness chip or the soul catcher is an apple seed sized microchip that is capable of holding a flawed recording of ones consciousness once a consciousness is recorded on the chip it is then implanted in a clone body or a real body which has less side effects if its a clone body they would need to get replacement bodies like every six months to a year possibly longer they go to certain military hospitals like the one near camp david to get a new clone if its implanted in a real persons body and turned on it bodysnatches kills the person and whatever consciousness that was recorded on the chip would then be in full control of that persons body after this is done that person would then be known as a chiphead however if someone dies and that dead consciousness was recorded on the chip and then implanted they would then be known as a dead chiphead also known as a reanimated or an undead chiphead they can implant the chip by drilling a hole in a persons head or they can remove ones eyeball and insert the chip with a rod to a certain depth in the brain the hyper thalamus region then they simply turn it on and it bodysnatches the person via technology as opposed to a vril lizard that bodysnatches one parasitically it messes up the person for like a month or something they can only sleep get up and eat in addition they have to have a nurse with them dead chipheads are gay or bi sexual not that theres something wrong with that evil theyre mentally impaired they have a handler theyre child molesters and sometimes they want to bite eat or kill people this is because the technology to bring them back from the dead is flawed and cannot be fixed ,0,2018-08-23,2018-08-20

2,-1,TJM-Qo0VZbs, honestly if there is a reason to buy intel the only one that i can think of is the availability of their product range for instance i would love to be able to build a custom sff daily driver pc with a 35w ryzen apu problem is that the 35w ryzen apus are not sold in boxed form they're only sold in tray lots to oems the other problem is that the 300 series apus are still zen and not zen 2 which is not necessarily bad but does mean it's behind the curve of amd's best offerings by comparison intel's lower tdp desktop parts however are available even if the integrated graphics are pretty crap compared to amd's similarly when i look back to the computex keynotes amd's was all about their own chips and cards intel's was all about products notebooks more or less coming out with their chips as much as i couldn't help but cringe at the comparison between ryzen 300 vs multilingual karaoke the fact that things like ultrabooks and such actually exist with decent intel parts is pretty much the main reason i can even think of to consider intel over amd at all all said i would love it even more if there were zen 2 counterparts to these but unfortunately they don't exist yet other than that i've got nothing as far as the question posed by the video title ,0,2019-07-10,2019-07-08

2,-1,TJM-Qo0VZbs, the only big problems that we have seen with ryzen 300 so far based on reports and reviews that have been released i can ultimately say are due to the negative effects of mercury retrograde which would explain issues such as improper test results or in anthony's case having to redo a lot from scratch incorrect bios updates and a rather mixed set of scenarios such as not a lot of current era x570 motherboards being available in the micro atx form factor x in inches which is the form factor that i am using for all of my sleeper rigs so i might opt for a 400 series if needed this is part of why i made the rounds on the comments on a good amount of tech programs to basically say to wait until after mercury is out of the retrograde zone rx zone and fully direct which is sometime in the latter half of august or wait for the 3950x to come out in september and opt for that chip especially if you can get it for a discount that is assuming that you are making a workstation with a titan rtx on a 500 usd budget now i am somebody who intends to not be biased towards one company over another despite me going on public record often that intel will always be able to beat amd on the same architecture level hence why i have high hopes for meteor lake in 2023 which is why sleeper pc c in my lineup the emachines et1331g 07w is being gutted out to have hardware from amd processor nvidia graphics card and intel coprocessor to prove that a literal rgb build albeit without rgb lighting can be possible provided you know where to look with no less than the 3950x titan rtx if not the quadro rtx 600 or 800 and xeon phi 7120a or 7120p following a possible bios mod to run it if necessary these three pieces of hardware probably would make for an ideal build that could last for at least the next decade and change before having to do another serious upgrade to it in 203x we could be in the picometers by then and likely still hold its own in other territory during that decade i've a good feeling about putting the 07 nanometer baby threadripper together with these and it will wishfully show that the three teams can coincide with one another the work on such a build will never end ,0,2019-07-11,2019-07-08

5,-1,u1Qn_KHM1GY, i think linus needs to double check that first apple story because it sounds like some of the facts got a bit jumbled up machine learning will be used to scan message attachments for sexually explicit content if the neural network determines that the attachment probably contains sexually explicit material it will blur out the content and provide a warning that stating that the image is most likely sexually explicit now as for the child pornography thing that doesn't require any machine learning that is nothing more than a hash key value check something that databases have been doing for years normally even the smallest modification to the image will result in a wildly different hash but apple is claiming that their hashing algorithm can get around some image manipulation legit online database storage services already do csam database checks two things are changing here first like i mentioned before apple is claiming that small modification to the image will still result in the same hash key and the naming convention that they're using for this does imply that their algorithm might partially ml based how they managed to do the training for this ml does raise some ethical issues because the only way to know if it works on images that contain csam is by running images that contain csam though it you can't really do that without having csam database of images not to be confused with a database of image hashes in your possession you can do small image manipulations to images that don't contain csam material and use that as a training base and this will result in something that probably works because it would be a bit like how they do feature detection for image recognition of people's faces as long as the generated features are the same for the manipulated image and the original image bur are different for other images that are similar then they can probably has the features instead of the image but probably works is not the same as we know it works the only way to truly know that it works is to run it through an actually database of known csam images also if they are using a nn the way that i think they are using an nn then i already have a few ideas for creating false positives so we don't know how well this new hashing algorithm works and if someone has child porn that isn't in the csam database then this database check won't do anything because that child porn isn't in the csam database the second thing that is changing is that the hash database check is being moved to the user's phone this is where privacy issues start to kick in apple will be checking people's phones for known content that is unwanted by someone else when it comes to csam content i think that's a good thing yet that known content will be found by checking a database that can be switched out for a different database i will repeat the database can be switched out for a different database so instead of checking for known images that contain csam apple can check for known images that contain xi jinping and winnie the pooh creating a list of people for the chinese government to detain or a database of image hashes for the star of david can be used to identify potential jewish people or a hash database of known depictions of allah can be used to create a list of people to have flogged in public apple might not be able to see most of the content that is on your phone but they can see your phone contains forbidden content ,0,2021-08-07,2021-08-02

1,-1,u2UGqLvq0_k, um i disagree with the gpu market analysis nvidia is still at the top of the gpu market with the 3080 and 3090 amd is relatively similar in terms of non ray traced gaming performance but nvidia still leads with their proprietary hardware and software with rtx i believe still fastest ray tracing dlss doesn't seem to be an equivalent yet for amd and tensor cores for accelerating ai based applications and most folks who have software that does gpu compute including but not limited to video editing software traditional 3d workstation software like blender etc uses cuda and those that also use opencl isn't as well supported or as performant in those modes also the video encoder on nvidia nvenc is way better looking than the amd equivalent it's more expensive but if you want the best it's still the 3080 3090 but if you don't care about ray tracing dlss or compute at all which i'm sure there's a pretty big swathe of gamers who fall into this group the amd options are looking really good especially for performance per dollar also i would venture a guess that amd might actually have better stock on their cards than nvidia and being able to get them in hand is likely to be a decisive factor in buying decisions for the first few months after amd's releases i've had the money and wanted to buy a 3090 since they were released but no retailers have the cards for which i'm happy to exchange my money to the point where i may even end up buying a 6900xt to hold me over until i can get my hands on a 3090 particularly with cyberpunk coming up and wanting to play control at something more than 40fps max on my 2080ti and with my hp reverb g2 about to ship ,0,2020-11-05,2020-11-02

5,-1,vjnLo1sLo7s, seems someone either didn't see the whole analysis video from gn or on the subjective plane didn't arrive at a similar conclusion rtx ray tracing deserves its criticism but the overall graphical impact on metro exodus with global illumination vs bf5 with some minor reflections is rather big imo how big inherently relies on the lighting of the scene dark scenes will have much less percievable impact it suffers a severe impact to performance and while very important to the overall experience that is neither here nor there for the overall graphical impact there are significant differences and it finally approaches on the intent of rt facilitating better graphical fidelity meaning more visual realism and thus greater immersion that does mean some areas that in reality would be darker become exactly that whether or not you want or prefer that in a shooter is gonna be an individual preference thing subjective but i imagine most will turn it off for competitive multiplayer sessions either way so greater visual realism does come with both advantages and potential drawbacks depending on your preferences and it can absolutely impact gameplay to its improvement or detriment though is gonna be largely subjective and likely be heavily dependent on what kind of gameplay any enabled game is aiming for personally i really like it in exosus so far but my personal preferences lean more towards a quality immersion than competitive gameplay anyways the ball is finally moving hopefully it can gain a little momentum i'm curious and excited to see how various studios implement and fiddle with this real time ray tracing has a loong way to go but at least its a start its just a shame it took half a year to get more than some minor novelty buggy reflections i don't think it took too much wind out of real time ray tracing as an emerging tech but it definitely and deservingly so took a lot of the wind out of rtx only time will tell how this story will progress ,0,2019-02-14,2019-02-11

2,-1,ZREP2KoiWYA, i wonder if part of the nvidia on arm thing is partially foreshadowing nintendo's future nintendo is held back on the switch because of the chipset it uses not having a true successor no true competition and individual components of the soc can't be upgraded arm with a dgpu now that nvidia is on board with it and as amd has that partnership with samsung should make an upgrade path easier to control for a mid gen upgrade for the switch's successor then there's also the obvious reasoning that arm is the future x86 is entering eol especially in the mobile department where efficiency is needed for longer battery life also nvidia on arm will also give linux users an easier time with drivers hopefully plus the fact that intel is trying to get into arm and the dgpu market i wonder if they'll be doing something similar to the samsung x amd thing or nvidia's arm gpu thing though nvidia wanting to buy out arm will make this interesting either it'll be a better way forward or we'll eventually see arm's successor honestly i wish arm on pc was to the point where we could have a comparison of the steam deck on x86 and arm i'm expecting the deck to do terribly because nobody will deal with the lack of battery life as x86 is entirely inefficient when it's not gimped and for this reason valve will lose interest in yet another hardware product because sales underperformed whereas the efficiency of arm would've made the deck a good idea sadly arm just isn't to the point of matching performance and software isn't there yet for bringing the desktop ecosystem to arm the product currently doesn't make sense hardware software isn't there and the market is still extremely niche it's a recipe for disaster ,0,2021-07-20,2021-07-19
