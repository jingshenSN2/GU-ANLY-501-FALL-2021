1, i honestly dont see why nvidia will want to do this tbh they getting demand like theyve never had before that being said i want a rtx 3080 but its never in stock ,0,Apr-21
1, i believe that nvidia has filed a patent for that silly controller and probably many more designs they will never make the patents they have are nice if someone else makes a close enough design in the future to extort money out of that vendor and make money on a otherwise useless patent you would be amazed if you look at the almost endless flow of patents just used this way the patent system sadly is broken as hell as is the protection of names those where made to protect inventors investments but have grown in a business model of it's own ,0,Jan-21
1, so the leaks that nvidia said won't be accurate because the previous leaks where nvidia said they won't be accurate but were were accurate lol ,1,Feb-19
2, soon we might be able to have enough space to load a computer from the memory of a video card ,3,Sep-21
1, i like nvidia but this move by them is total bs however it'll be hacked as soon as it's released there is no such thing as totally secure ,0,Feb-21
1, that mining limiter refresh is not a real story everyone is using each other as the source at no point has nvidia confirmed it ,0,Apr-21
2, hahaha glad i did not stand in line at micro center for days to get one 3080ti is my card ,0,Sep-20
2, the rtx 2060 is a really good card i like ltt but get off that ivory 3080 3090 tower if this card is around 400 during the chip shortage it'll be a 200 win the 6 gb 2060 msrp was at 360 it probably won't though it'll be overpriced out of the gate because of the shortage but it's still a win to have anything on the shelves it's really nice they are bringing a 300 card back with more vram for higher resolution gaming etc given the shortage i just hope it lasts on shelves a bit and doesn't get scalped we can always hope retailers vet the sales better ,1,Sep-21
1, due to the incompetence of many e tailers not using captcha or any bot protection at all the chance of people other than scalpers getting a 3070 are slim maybe they will properly stock the stores as thats the only chance you will get it in person anytime the 3080 gets restocked online it is still being picked up by bots what a joke of a launch of a new series of cards ,0,Sep-20
2, free tip use pcpartpicker for finding in stock gpus it works i found an rtx 3070 and rtx 3080 for msrp ,2,Nov-20
1, nvidia cmp mining gpus are basically trash the mh is half what a new gpu will do at the exact same wattage so it actually makes more sense to buy the crippled gpu because it might actually have slightly better efficiency the only saving grace would be if they aggressively price these cards wayy below the price of newer or even older cards but it's nvidia so you know it's gonna be stupid expensive ,0,Feb-21
1, if amd loved us they would not have rx 5600 xt sapphire pulse cards that if you install the drivers when the screen turns off it stays off forever or until you reinstall windows and linux forget it ,0,May-20
2, rt rtx sweet a shame those cards will have to wait until my 2 cards i bought in january breaks in about 4 8 years i only upgrade buy new components upon component failure looking forward to see what ray tracing cards looks like in 2026 and how well they will work with blender can't wait to see how rtx cards perform d ,0,Aug-18
1, the cards will be only marginally better if at all to their gtx counterparts and be only superior in raytraicing which no game currently offers and just a couple of them will have limited implementation in the next year at a ridiculous premium over the already ridiculous prices that's why they still sell gtx cards and prices even in the official nvidia store are still standing much higher over mspr and also that's why we did not see any benchmarks ,19,Aug-18
0, if they called it an 1160 theyre concerned it will be confused with 10 series cards and if they call it a 2050 theyre concerned itll be confused with rtx cards 1660 rolls off the tongue and thats probably why they chose it ,0,Feb-19
0, taiwan and most of southeast asia was hit by a massive typhoon which has likely disrupted logistics nvidia announced the delay right after the typhoon hit over the weekend this is more than likely the reason for the delay ,13,Sep-18
1, 4x better than the x 8k res 120fps sony fanboys be like that graphics are trash and its super slow windows gamer gives him slap how dare you this is the brother of windows nintendo f their better now i think we just must make better motion controlls ,0,Jun-19
1, nvidia got fucked over by greedy game publishers and devs that didnt want players to play games they already paid for ,0,Mar-20
1, why are they already making a new card when they cant even keep up with demand it don't make sense put all the effort into developing selling the 3070 80 and 90 ,0,Nov-20
2, how old are you i am so old i can remember when tnt2 was cool 3dfx voodoo was cooler and geforce was this weird new brand from the tnt2 guys also quake 3 and unreal tournament the first one was the bomb but i was the poor kid with my sis graphics card so only warcraft 2 red alert 1 2 and half life in software mode for me ,0,Aug-20
1, i'm so tired of these gpu prices i'm still running one of my two gtx 760's his brother died long ago ,0,Jun-18
1, it can overload the capacitors causing a crash well isn't that a gross oversimplification of the issue of proper supply rail decoupling using high quality properly calculated capacitors to decrease the amount of supply noise induced jitter in order to ensure maximum stability of the gpu ,0,Sep-20
2, nvidia could've added mining locks on all nvidia cards except for the gtx 480 and before now that's what i call very epic at least miners can mine on amd cards cuz they are ok pricing and very epic performance or a gameboy graphics for the gamers boii ,0,Apr-21
1, rip nvidia took the easy road everyone knows retailers don't give a flying fuck about scalpers as long as the stock sells it means nothing else so prepare to add a few extra months of wait and stupidly jacked up prices on 3070 3080 gpus ,0,Oct-20
0, if they sold only 10 of the cards people want to buy now and it has been 1 month then you can buy a 3080 next fall ok or summer as earliest with amd joining the hype of not having any cards ,0,Dec-20
2, imho like the rtx 2k series when they had gtx 1660 cards why not a gtx 2660 i e no raytracing dlss yes nvidia notice my fatcat avatar and hire me for your products dept ,0,Jan-21
2, you all say that you cant play with bugs and low frames that drop to 120 we in latinamerica loving what we have with rtx potato on our base consoles and hamster engined pc's ,0,Dec-20
1, i had to buy a laptop for school in july i needed something that would last a while so i got a 1065g7 but it kind of sucks now that the 11th gen 1135g7 beats it and has way better integrated graphics at least i didn't buy a 2080ti a few months back ,0,Oct-20
0, kotor 1 2 rtx please because at this point we will never get a remaster from bioware and if we did it would have loot boxes in it ,2,Oct-19
2, i want it for rs 200 or less no more tho also 12 gb vram will be good for gpu rendering in blender ,0,Sep-21
1, reviewers and journalists who got sent free gpus got their shit bricked when trying a new game my heart bleeds for them ,0,Jul-21
2, idk the zen 2 chips look dope as fuck but the radeons still don't seem worth it not only are they barley on par in tests they chose for their cards but the cards are now uglier than ever and you don't get ray tracing buying amd is like buying nvidea but you just don't get ray tracing which makes no sense whether you like it or not it is still free and takes nothing more from you ,0,Jun-19
0, cool another high end gaming gpu how many megahash this time and who are the two people who are able to get it ,2,Aug-21
0, i'm not buying minecraft rtx if they keep it only in the bedrock version java version is awesome yes there's a lot of bugs in the java version but it makes it so much fun for me ,0,Aug-19
2, i'm hoping they're going to sell those excess gpus for just 10 per gpu that excess would turn into recess ,0,Jun-18
2, i saw this and i was hoping that amd matched the gram of the rtx3090 but yet i choosed nvidia for this one for professional purposes but hats off to amd they crushed it ,0,Oct-20
0, since nvidia sits on 300k gpu chips they will bring some intermediate 10 series with gddr6 as a special and offset the 11 series ,0,Jun-18
0, watching this and confused as hell saying that i swear that the rtx was released then saw the upload date facepalm ,0,May-21
1, its 1180 why would they change the number progression they have kept this while time if the next isnt called 1180 i will say piss off to nvidia and not upgrade my card but wait for amd ,0,Aug-18
1, i have to assume that the unhackable claim is a marketing 4d chess to artificially increase sales by people who are going to hack it just to spite nvidia i mean there's no way that a major hardware manufacturer can be that stupid given the literal decades worth of computer security research that has gone into repeatedly refuting this claim right i mean there's been cases where software has been hacked hours after launch they can't be that stupid right right ,0,Feb-21
2, i think the gpu shortege is going away very soon because at my local microcenter has a bunch of 6600xt 3080ti 6900xt 3060 3060 ti most times of the week oh and also most 3090s but only at about 10 at a time so yeah also new egg is getting a lot of strix 3090 btw so use the app hot stocks if u want a gpu for msrp ,1,Aug-21
0, a video card does it have its own case power supply hard drive etc so it will do everything without the rest of the normal computer components ,0,Apr-19
2, people kinda mischaracterize what amd fine wine means actually it might be more accurate to say that there are two dueling definitions of the term and they both mean something different more recently it's been that nvidia cards age badly so amd cards look better by comparison originally though i believe the term first came up when amd first introduced the gcn architecture basically what happened is that over the lifespan of those first few cards driver updates ended up improving performance by something like thirty percent i don't have the exact figures on hand but it was absurd now we're probably not going to see something quite that dramatic with rdna a five to ten percent performance improvement over the first few cards lifespan is probably possible though i'm not so confident that i'd put money on it mind you but it is a new architecture it's not terribly uncommon for there to be a bit of performance improvement as the software engineers figure out a new gpu's little quirks and foibles something else to keep in mind is that if the 500 series sells well enough you might see a few developers putting out some optimization patches for their games as well that probably wouldn't be that big of an improvement mind you as anthony pointed out the performance penalty for poor optimization just isn't as big as it was before still the 5700 series and the rtx super series are close enough in performance already that stuff like this could make a difference we won't necessarily see the 500 series leapfrog nvidia's offerings mind you but we may see a few games where the gap closes or amd even manages to jump out ahead again i'm not so confident that i'd put money on it still it could happen so we'll just have to wait and see many people are going to want to wait for partner aib's anyway so you know unless you need a card right this moment are very confident in amd or prefer nvidia products as a general rule of thumb waiting a month or so probably isn't gonna hurt things ,0,Jul-19
1, just letting us play games on p106 100 like cards would help but oh no nvidia is like fuck gamers gimme that cash just imagine how shitty they are acting ,0,Sep-21
1, they won't give me the gpu i did ask for say they have something i don't want yeah seems right ,0,May-21
2, i really want a gpu i'm still using 2200g i want at least 1660 super or 3050 if it exist ,1,Mar-21
0, so tesla is gonna drop the tegra hopefully now nvidia would optimize the tegra xavier for laptops and portable consoles ,0,Jul-18
0, the 9 series could be their new stopping point in driver support dropping up to 700 cards so they want to fill the low end area replacing the gt 710 wont be surprised if we get a gt 1040 lol idk about 800 laptops but i think their based off the 700 series so they may go to ,0,Jan-21
1, sure a noctua card sounds nice but they haven't promised to do anything to get them to actual customers instead of scalpers and miners so don't get your hopes up ,1,Aug-21
0, here the first in game test in of the new rtx3080 card url grretings from hans of the dutch lowlands nl ,0,Aug-20
1, amd ohh we see you struggling to get a gpu hey we'll help here we'll waste them on freaking cars instead of selling um to you plebs like thats almost as assholish as what nvidia did ,0,May-21
0, hahahahaha you just worked that out how old is the 1080ti like nvidia ceo jensen huang said time to upgrade ,0,Nov-20
0, is super laptops just an excuse to delay 300 series laptops whenever the 300 series happens i feel like this announcement is closer to the future 300 series than it was to desktop super cards ,0,Mar-20
1, tbh thats what they get i hope they keep getting robbed this scalping ruins the experience for everyone else who isn't a content creator with the 4 cards these companies make a week ,0,Nov-20
1, cryptomining is just a bad as gambling fitting that huge gpu system is in vegas people dont seem to remember the last time the bitcoin bubble popped went from 20k to k people just dont seem to understand that the cryptocurrency market is highly highly highlly susceptible to manipulation we will see that system being parted out within the year ,0,Dec-20
1, i call bs i follow the crypto market and nvidia is a part of that in a q1 press release they said they were aware the crypto gold rush might not last and that they were prepared for a rough 2nd and 3rd q also the brave browser is aweaome and its not convoluted they use their own proprietary token in platform it's fairly straight forward ,0,Jun-18
0, there will be 10 whole lhr gpus 10 00 normal hashrate ones working as intended also they hacked the lhr ones ,1,Apr-21
2, i am currently using a w5500 in my main rig because of all the shortages it was the only card i could find in stock when i needed one and it was available for msrp 430 where the consumer gpu it's based on the 5500 xt was already selling for 800 at that point i'm honestly considering getting a w6800 just for the fact that it will be cheaper than probably even a 5700 xt ,0,Jun-21
2, the new rtx series is a wrong step made by nvidia raytracing isn't really ready for the market only a significantly small amount of games support raytracing and the high performance usage of this method isn't rentable even the 2080ti struggles on 4k with raytracing enabled the next big issue in my opinion is the price mostly all new releases meant a significant drop in terms of prices but the price performance of the new generation is exactly the same as the old generation only enthusiasts will consider buying these for those of you who already have a pascal gpu or one of the rx series won't really consider purchasing it ,0,Jan-19
0, nice amd cards that bit about sharpening is horseshit though there's been a thing called reshade for years that adds sharpening for little to no fps loss ,1,Jun-19
2, gaming has yet to even begin making the 2080 ti sweat gamers frothing at the mouth for a new series of cards that aren't really relevant outside of workstation loads seriously for most gamers the 2080 ti is overkill and will continue to be overkill for years to come why because games are never designed with modern hardware in mind yeah you crank all the dials if you want to but the base experience is pretty damn good itself unless a game is specifically designed to be played on the current top tier hardware it's both stupid and wasteful to chase said hardware in the case of the 3080 i kind of get it you get basically 2080 ti performance at half the cost that makes sense ,0,Nov-20
0, soo nvidia isnt allowing freesync over displayport if so this isnt a win both need to work over display port fuck nvidia ,0,Nov-19
1, and i wanted to do a summer job to get enough money for rtx 3060ti i guess it won't happen ,0,Jan-21
0, minecraft not graphically impressive well yes if you play the crap windows version if you play java with 128 texture pack and a shade pack then no it looks amazing but noobs be noobs i guess ,0,Aug-19
2, considering that these mining cards aren't supposed to decrease gaming gpu stock i think we should wait and see if it does help i'm sure it will at least slow down the miners a little bit ,0,Feb-21
0, is thunderbolt 4 going to allow more discrete gpus to be plugged into machines that have them through that bus ,0,Nov-20
2, i'm truly excited by the new gpus and those rtx trailers and demos real time ray tracing and ai being used in games i mean to me that's actually mind blowing the amount of research and clever math behind it all must be ridiculous and to see it all in action on an affordable gpu relatively speaking compared to super computers is just incredible can't wait to play the first games implementing it like bf v and ff 15 or control such a strong lineup of games adopting it so early on go innovation ,0,Aug-18
2, quick question would an overclocked 6700k support an rtx 3090 not that i can buy one my bank account surely is in shambles ,0,Aug-21
0, m1 chip outperforms the gtx 1050 ti and rx560 in benchmark of course i'd expect a 1499 laptop have gpu better than 1060ti rx560 many 800 100 laptop even have gtx 1060 6gb but does it even matter who play games on a mac ,1,Nov-20
1, then the miner sell their gpu like 85 of the msrp that price is too high for a gpu that run 24 7 non stop even if they didn't oc it ,0,Nov-20
1, so what are the rumours about a new 3080rtx it's going to be expensive wow you could knocked me down with a feather ,0,Jun-20
1, if i had a dollar for everytime i hear someone mention my country in relation to criminals hiding i would have bought my own rtx 3090 ,0,Jul-21
0, 2 nice things to hear in this world are 1 new gpu release dates 2 anthony's voice after many days ,519,May-20
0, nvidia better not be releasing a 1660 super that sounds like a really really stupid thing to do cause like that's the who fucking point of the 1660 ti ,0,Oct-19
0, im here from the future dont buy the rtx 200 series rtx 3070 is better than the 2080ti and for only 499 ,0,Aug-20
2, with how many new graphics cards already in the works why not just delay it until we got like huge ass jump in performance and features because if the new nvidia ada lovelace is any indication i'll just wait until the new one next year or the year after that ,0,Dec-20
0, so if rtx stands for roytex does that mean gtx stands for gaytex k sorry all homosexuals i didn't intend to be mean i have nothing against people who are gay or lesbian ,0,Aug-18
2, i really like this just be more detailed you say price drops but i needa know what cards by how much and relative to invidia price whats better in that new price point i amd fanboy too ,0,Jul-19
1, pulling driver support on older cards in the midst of the worst gpu shortage we've ever seen is just cruel ,0,Jun-21
1, legit trying to find any decent graphics card right now means paying almost double their launch price there are literally rx570s that cost the launch price of 5700xts ,2,Jan-21
1, it's nvidia's fault the cards have to be able to operate at 100 load safely when the card fries itself in such a situation it means that the driver boost algorithm was too aggressive ,0,Jul-21
1, trying to downplay the gpu bs why because your business is based on us being able to buy this crap ,0,Sep-21
1, laptops are becoming more of a value proposition with scalpers and miners buying up all the cards i doubt a miner would want a laptop with just one gpu ,0,Nov-20
2, you can kiss goodbye the 699 and 1499 prices like the 99 rtx 2080ti nvidia lied about for more than 2 years ,0,Oct-20
0, only tards buy these low end cards for 1080p lets be real if you want 1080p its mostly for 24 monitors with 144hz 240hz and this wont do that for long especially not on aa titles ,0,Oct-19
2, i mean the mining card option may not be bad if they have higher hashrate cost watt efficiency vs the 3060 the limitations are only on the 3060 thus far and not on existing cards out in the wild at all although honestly i find us in the mining realm aim more for 3070 3070ti if your serious on making that sweet sweet eth before eth launch kills its mining granted prob another year and half by that time ,0,Feb-21
0, uhs 1 on the steam deck sd slot seems stupid weak ideally you'd want uhs 3 support for a2 cards uhs 1 is slow as f ,0,Jul-21
0, no one is gonna notice how you would have to turn the card upside down which would make the logo upside down ,1,Oct-20
2, the 2060 is reasonably priced i dont get who this card is for my gtx 1060 has no problem keeping up with aa titles and does a decent job keeping up with premiere i havent even ocd it yet and consistently get over 60fps on moderate to high setting so what gives nvidia ,0,Jan-19
2, i've got a 3080 i'm reselling i'm not into graphics cards or have little to no use for them and i only purchased it for benchmarking purposes and i'm selling it at not the usual bend you over because your desperate price of 1300 but i'm selling my 3080 not f e for 980 ,0,Oct-20
1, crippled bruh gpus are for gaming not dumbass crypto mining plus youd probably make less than 2 a day mining on a non limited 3060 and thats not even considering the cost of power ,0,Feb-21
0, no rtx on minecraft isnt we had super duper cut a shader pack that could of ran on almost all platforms cut for a rtx pack which only works on pc and even then its a limited subset of pc very disappointed in it ,0,Aug-19
0, why the console build is more affordable than the full pledge pc build one navi gpu is more pricy than the newxbox ,0,Jun-19
2, i don't know if amd will ever recover from their setback when the 10 series of nvidia launched with more and more games relying on nvidias api's i think amd really needs to consider specializing on something else or start emulating nvidia software ,0,Sep-18
0, dj bobo lol nvidia since you cant buy any 300 series gpu since like half a year or more they talk about 400 series already many fucking lols ,0,Apr-21
2, the freesync on nvidia thing got me really excited until i read what it really was it's stupid and it's useless you're adding a totally unnecesary bottleneck latency by spending extra money that you could very well spend on the difference between a normal freesync monitor and a g sync one as an experiment nice to know ,2,Aug-18
1, yes i can actually buy it but do i is spending 700 on rtx 3060ti can be called purchase or throwing money in to scalper hands ,0,Nov-20

0, i don't get it i'm using i5 3570s since 2012 and never had issues with performance yup still on ddr3 just changing graphics cards that's the main boost rtx 2070 atm ,0,Jul-19
1, i'm no business person but perhaps maybe nvidia devoting some of their resources to re releasing old cards instead of pumping more supply of new cards couldn't possibly be a good thing like why waste material on remaking 2060's instead of putting them towards something like a 3060 ,0,Sep-21
1, i am sad because i got the rtx 2080 before all the super and ti variants of the 200s came out and now i just feel like i wasted my money ,0,Nov-20
1, if nvidia comes out with super cards at the same price they are going to piss off everyone that bought an rtx card ,0,Jun-19
2, i love the long dark but holy hell has hinterland cashed in a ton of social capital to stick it to nvidia and their fans of their game ,0,Mar-20
2, i'm currently bypassing the 3060 limiter in my mining rig i believe the 3080ti anti mining for eth will likely work but like it needs to be more than ethereum ethereum is going away from mining at the end of 2021 so that's not even what people are going to be buying graphics cards to mine anymore ,0,Apr-21
1, bitcoin noo cryptocurrency made my 1070 so expensive back in the day the last thing new red and green gpus need is another bitcoin craze with miners ordering 3080 and 6800 xt in bulk ,0,Nov-20
1, thats funny when i tried to buy a gtx 1080 at best buy they were out and when they tried to order me one they couldnt even order me one ,0,Jun-18
0, this is the video where many people learn that not everyone needs a high powered gpu because not everyone is a gamer ,0,Jan-21
0, looks like my 980 is 42 percent faster than 1650 looks like card is paying off in the long run it was expensive af compared to the one i'm comparing it to ,0,Oct-19
1, to be fair scalpers would probably have taken those cards if the crypto miners didn't get them and honestly i hate scalpers much more at least the crypto miners are actually using the cards ,0,Nov-20
0, the new top connector looks to be the nvlink system hopefully its enabled the way i understand it based on the gv100 cards if it is functional it will allow for shared memory use across multiple cards so in theroy if you have 2 gtx1180 2080 cards each with 16gb of onboard ram you get 32gb of shared card ram over nvlink for rendering and visualization this would be awesome ,0,Aug-18
1, we wouldnt be in as bad of a gpu situation if gpu companies didnt make side cards and focoused on the big 4 ,0,May-21

1, everyone ill buy amd because theyll have a better launch than nvidia amd worse launch than nvidia everyone surprised pikachu face ,15,Nov-20
1, ok nvidia knows by now that if you tell the internet something isn't hack able its will get hacked and then most likely your company will get targeted for hacking because you think your smarter then the internet being that is is just an update they can just roll the gfx cards drivers back or flash a custom bios on to it ,0,Feb-21
2, amd be like let's release a new series right after nvidia at a slightly lower price to see how many people we can scoop up ,0,Sep-18
2, well let me kms rtx 2080 is 900 100 in my country hope this is just the pre order price ,2,Aug-18
2, wtf 300k gpus have been sent back and yet we're still paying over msrp on them ffs just have a fire sale and i'll buy one right now until the 1180 comes out make them available ,195,Jun-18
2, to be fair the fact amd and nvidia keep churning out new cards instead of making a ton of current gen one so the prices stabilise just goes to show how little they give a flying fuck about anything but money ,1,Sep-21
2, i actually was able to find an rtx 3090 in stock on newegg canada for 2600 cad i didn't buy it because i couldn't afford it edit it was a zotac trinity one ,2,Nov-20
2, 30 series just seems to be nvidia trying to figure out how to mass market vaporware on the hardware side ,0,Sep-20
2, if they are re releasing the 2060 do they already have a stock of chips sitting is a warehouse somewhere if not then why reduce the already insufficient production of 30 series chips to make more it is almost like nvidia has their head shoved so far up their rectum that if a good idea hit them in their ass it would give them a concussion and let's face it they aren't fooling anyone with their stab you in the back while cleaning out your wallet marketing approach ,0,Sep-21
1, i swear it's like september is the opposite month for 2020 nvidia amd and now xbox too everything is getting pro consumer all of a sudden ,0,Sep-20
2, url for ray tracing and dlss performance were going to have a look at 1080p and 1440p performance well be comparing the rtx 3060 ti with the 2060 super and the rx 6800 which is currently the cheapest radeon gpu that supports ray tracing though its not a direct competitor for the 3060 ti as we saw before the 3060 ti is 34 faster than the 2060 super in watch dogs legion at 1080p and with ray tracing enabled that margin doesnt change much using ultra quality ray tracing the rtx 3060 ti is 38 faster and 41 faster with medium quality rt by steven walton ,0,Dec-20
0, just give me a card that you can buy in a store i would love to buy a 3070 or 3080 ,0,Aug-21
0, pc cost less huh just a mid tier graphics card alone cost more then a console how long does the average pc gamer keep that around no really honest question here ,0,Feb-19

1, it saddens me this overhype of navi will probably lead to unjustified disappointment by people who misunderstood the architecture i am personally looking forward to it for the price to performance and relatively lower wattage promises but it seems there are now many people expecting navi to blow out all nvidia cards on the cheap which is just an unrealistic expectation looking at amd's gpu past and their current priorities ,1,Jun-20

0, honestly no devs shouldn't get a cut from geforce now geforce now is using a normal steam install on a server that streams games to other devices the infrastructure is entirely from nvidia and the devs didn't influence it in the slightest not to mention that you have to buy the game on steam so the developer gets the money they chose to charge for the game they have no business charging more money for a service they don't provide themselves ,1,Mar-20
0, do you even need adaptive refresh rate nowadays on nvidia gpus i use fast sync in the nvidia control panel for all games and have 0 tearing with no noticeable latency increase if i lock fps to my monitor's refresh rate 60 as an alternative solution if some game doesn't work with fast sync then tearing becomes a non issue basically 99 of the time unless framerate drops below it too much too often which i can avoid by just turning down settings to have a more consistent fps i feel like all this desperation for getting freesync on nvidia gpus is really dumb because there's solutions already that work perfectly well for gamers with cheaper mid range graphics cards and people who buy 1080 tis are probably rich enough to afford a gsync monitor for higher refresh rate gaming where adaptive sync actually plays it's role ,0,Aug-18

0, that's not fair i'm sure you'll be able to play cyberpunk 2077 with raytracing on in full resolution by the time nvidya comes out with a 40 series or the 50 series so obviously hardware unboxed should be hyping 1500 cards that can't handle it now and actually cost 500 ,1,Dec-20

2, if true i'm perfectly fine with amd killing radeon vii to release a higher end navi based gpu sooner rather than later obviously they'll want the 5700 5700xt to sell some decent figures first both reference and partner cards i get that i just hope it offers a similar price to performance to power efficiency ratio as it sounds like the 3700x does for gaming it doesn't even need to increase performance over radeon vii let alone reach 2080ti levels the same 1440p performance numbers as radeon vii at a much less power hungry usage than radeon vii or nvidia equivalent gpus is what i'm personally waiting for ,0,Jul-19
1, nvidia up until 20 series i would consider no other card since i couldn't get a 3080 i again got pissed with there over estimating figures and everything they've done i was impressed with amd subtle but truthful launch i decided they deserved my support however i'll remember what they did to hardware unboxed which i only just discovered researching the cards it'll take nvidia several years to earn back my trust now i'm today no longer an nvidia fanboi ,0,Dec-20

2, sadly the rx 570 and 580 are still super cheap even brand new and often come with free games or deals etc you can also pick up used gpus for a fantastic deal sometimes but basically the fact that the rx 5500 is being compared to the gtx 1650 and not 1660 that means it won't be very powerful good for an itx gpu perhaps though there are other alternatives such as an itx 1660 amd already have fantastic budget 1080p cards such as the 580 or even 590 but it would be cool if they made alternatives to that category still cool though hopefully they release good quality itx cards and low profile ones it's sad that amd don't have any low profile cards besides a 560 perhaps ,0,Oct-19
