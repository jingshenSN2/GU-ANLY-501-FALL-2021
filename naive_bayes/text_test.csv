0, using gpus to mine bitcoin you might as well burn paper money it's been asics doing it for years now nevertheless i presume selling thousands bulk is better than a few here and there to gamers besides once profitability goes away everyone can buy them used for a fraction of the price ,1,Dec-20
0, when are we going to stop saying that someone broke the anti mining driver that nvidia made it wasn't hacked at all they simply installed a driver that didn't have the code on it or altered something on the board physically that's on the same level as someone who thinks 10 everyday hacks are actually hacks it's not they just installed a bios that didn't have the code for the handshake i saw a second method but i think it had something to do with changing chips or power connections essentially changing out pieces of hardware which again isn't a hack that's a bypass those are worse for nvidia than someone hacking it due to the childishly easy ways around it but i haven't seen any record of someone breaking the code without physically altering it or just swapping to an older bios ,0,Apr-21
0, what video card has the best results when refreshing pages lol perhaps an analog signal could have less latency making you able to place your order ms faster ,0,Nov-20
0, they should use sd cards instead of discs for consoles hell with game prices well over 150 if you include all the dlc and goty editions they should use ssds instead of discs disc drives are so cheap i don't really understand the push to get rid of them however with sd card's and ssd's less chance of data loss due to scratches ,0,Apr-19
0, the clip shown in this article still doesn't prove the 20gb card was real people have been hacking vbios for years the misreport what the card is hell people have even been known to solder more vram onto cards even though they run like shit ,0,Sep-21
0, so is amd also nerfing the video cards like nvidia which makes me wonder why can't they just nerf the video cards to prevent crypto mining and not making mining specific cards ,0,Mar-21
0, i really don't even see that as a problem if you're mad then you're probably planning on buying zen 3 so why not upgrade to a pci e 4 gpu also b450 doesn't offer pci e 4 but b550 does what i'm trying to say is that at some point you're going to need a new motherboard anyway ,0,May-20
0, the us cannot spell security let alone implement security disagree look at the hundreds of millions of credit cards stolen nsa security leeks nasa hacks cia hacks us security is a joke ,0,Jul-19
0, i like how nvidia showcased the performance with raytracing turned on all three of those games with ray tracing released in the last two years will run so much faster ,0,Aug-20
0, sonic ether makes ptgi path traced global illumination for java edition without gpu pestrictions mojang oh we can do that too but only on windows 10 edition aanndd you need rtx20xx card ,0,Aug-19
0, radeon vii was obviously just a filler to fill the gap while amd prepared navi if it wasn't for the much faster and extra expensive hbm2 it wouldn't have competed at all ,0,Jul-19
0, i feel that nvidia saying their card is unhackable will be seen as a challenge to those with vested interests and will only serve to accelerate the time frame for which it will be hacked ,1,Feb-21
0, ok nvidia will definitely patch that quickly just like they did with physx people used to run a low end nvidia card with an amd gpu and ran the physx on the nvidia card now if the geforce drivers detect an amd video card the nvidai one disables all it's features ,0,Aug-18
0, so if micron already began mass production of gddr 6 memory will the price of the next gen gtx 11 series graphics card drop ,0,Jun-18
0, 120fps 1440p on a 4tf gpu i think phil drastically need's cut down on the amount of weed he's smokin' ,0,Sep-20
0, that's unfortunate amd ati was not great with the hd 600 or prior support but i think nvidia is becoming the worse player here amd still support gcn which is launched in late 2011 and nvidia is dropping support for card in early 2012 ,0,Jun-21
0, doubt itll happen but wish they would put those 300k gpus up for sale at a discounted price or somethin lol ,55,Jun-18

0, here is bryan's contact information publicly available on nvidia website bryan del rizzo geforce desktops and notebooks esports bdelrizzo nvidia com 1 408 486 2772 we should tell him how we feel about this ,0,Dec-20
0, yeah the website you showed had increased prices on graphics cards is pcdiga which is pretty much the only good retailer in portugal the rtx 3070 used to be priced from 550 to 850 but now its close to 100 the worst part is you could actually buy cards there because they had a limit of cards per day every other hour they added like 10 cards in stock even tho they had more in their inventory so that they could maintain a steady stream of sales to actual people through the months now its just bs ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia paid minecraft's dev to cancel update announced almost 2 years ago that was supposed to be giant graphics overhaul as a reason for cancellation devs said it was too hard for them to do it across all devices so they will use easier sarcasm to implement ray tracing that is available on a fraction of systems thanks nvidia for not letting devs to improve game for everyone ,0,Aug-19
0, i feel like crypto mining is good for the gpu industry it broadens the market and a big yes to repair ratings ,0,Dec-20
0, just say the gt1010 is a better mining card than a 200 300 or 500 600 gpu and the market will return to normal miners are idiots just watch someone is going to take this joke seriosly ,1,Jan-21
0, so everyone using geforce now should try to play around with the steam launcher within the application some programs can be downloaded with a warning going along the line of sure you can download it but we can't guarantee it'll work it's a cloud computer while companies with stadia deals might not be able to advertise games on it you should be able to play your games with nvidia's hardware using your steam account ,0,Feb-20
0, hii we need a real study on the pcie for example versus 3700x z570 5700xt vs 9700k z390 rtx 2080 or ti in order to know what is the real impact of the pcie compare to the pcie pls ,0,Jul-19
0, it makes a lot of sense for nvidia to sell the cards to crypto miners at this moment because allegedly some of those mining factories are located very close to the production of the videocards which makes transport not a problem this is a much better option than transporting to countries who are on lockdown right now making deliveries very difficult or impossible or slow ,0,Nov-20
0, still not know why anyone would buy something better than gtx1080ti cause i still cannot find any game that is worth buying a new graphics card maybe when raytracing arrives in most of the actual games it is worth think about a swap ,0,Jun-20
0, oh my friggin gawd everyone who is bitching about the 30fps bullshit is so ignorant it makes me weep thats 30 50fps while raytracing which is something that usually takes quadro computers hours or days to render a single frame these cards are doing thirty to fifty of those same frames every second that is a big deal ,0,Aug-18

0, for a few weeks i was running a monitor cable from my amd motherboard alongside the cables from my nvidia gpu games locked up a lot like after about 10 minutes of play every time so don't do it kids in theory you can run 2 different graphics adapters at the same time but just don't ,0,Aug-18
0, ethereum mining isnt even profitable anymore no cryptominers are buying gpus asics already have a significantly better value and gpus cant compete ,0,Jun-21
0, how can all these kids afford rtx cards i could barely buy a ds game when i was a minor ,10,Nov-20
0, 2005 hey guys look at the thing i bought tells the world that physx is the biggest innovation nobody cares now 2014 hey guys look at the thing i made launches hairworks saying it's the biggest innovation nobody cares now this just made my game lose 30fps 2018 hey guys look at the thing i made launches raytracing dedicated cards saying it's the world's biggest innovation i wonder where will this take us ,0,Aug-18
0, starting to understand why amd let the old gpu team go all honesty seems like it was a smart move ,0,Dec-19
0, i'm wondering if they have designed it to work in unison with the currently unknown traditional console they are creating potentially allowing the streaming device to also act as an external gpu maybe ,0,Jul-18
0, get your bullshit drivers straight then i'll buy no way am i buying radeon cards at this point note i'm not a fanboy i have a reference vega 64 in the other room g'day ,0,Jun-20
0, i've been voiding warranties by re seating gpu heatsinks and replacing those crappy noisy fans with noctua ones for years it might not be the prettiest solution but it's so damn quiet this way also phanteks halos is a thing and it works great with noctua chroma and redux fans ,3,Aug-21
0, i amp amped about this new amped graphics card which will probably need a lot of amps ill head out the door now ,2,Apr-20
0, i hate this app store change i have a ton of itunes gift cards and i just use them to buy subscriptions and stuff so now im basically out of luck ,0,Aug-21
0, nvidia doesn't need anyone's permission becuase they're not putting any games on their service they're renting a vm the games are already owned by the users beforehand someone need to compile a list of that shitty devs so that i can never buy from them again ,0,Mar-20
0, damn saw that headline and thought maybe he means more cards available but instead we have more cards that dont exist that you cant buy ,0,Nov-20
0, mining specific gpus are dumb they do not slow miners from buying gaming gpus when the gaming cards are gone at decent prices then miners will buy the mining gpus the entire point to mining on a desktop gpu is the resale value otherwise gpu miners might as well buy asics and fpgas ,0,Mar-21
0, why is the thumb nail is amd is on fire while it's trading blows with nvidia at lower power consumption ,0,Oct-20
0, nvidia should do a massive sale on their own websites and sell the gpu's for under msrp to get rid of them all ,0,Jun-18
0, nvidia geforce now is very consumer friendly which is why companys don't like it this is what we've been waiting for a way to remotely render games we already own i find it funny shadow doesn't have the same problem ,0,Mar-20
0, i think that the solution for this is a valid id number and matching credit card name limit 1 for preorders ,0,Sep-20
0, noctua fans are great but this is the wrong fan configuration for cooling a graphics card and i can't believe graphics cards are still using it in the age of 300 watt gpus the best cooling configuration for a graphics card is a turbine fan not a radial fan and the turbine fan should push cool air along the length of the card and out through the ventilated slot cover even multiple radial fans blowing air directly onto the circuit board cannot achieve the same cooling capacity as a single turbine fan blowing air along the length of the card and the hot air stays inside the case instead of being evacuated out the back it's a bad design and there is no excuse for it ,1,Aug-21
0, aus retailers ruined the 3080 launch too with their dumb ass prices rtx 3080 699usd msrp 970aud i paid almost 1300aud some cards are like 1600aud ps5 499 msrp 700aud preorder now 750aud lmfao well done pc stores push more people to consoles fucking idiots ,0,Sep-20
0, so now we are supposed to get a special 100 graphics card to have realistic lighting in minecraft even tho shaders are a thing since like 10 years and they are for free and by the way can be used with any decent gpu ,0,Aug-19
0, an over abundance of nvidia product how about retailers lower the price on them back to msrp so that manufactures can move them ,2,Jun-18
0, i don't know how ltt managed to screw this up risc v is not arm this is about an amd gpu on risc v this is not about arm hopefully this was an honest typo ,58,Jul-21
0, lol they dont care haha guess what i stopped carring too rtx 2060is the last card i ever bought from them i simply do not care about any new lineup of cards cant do gaming forever and i am prety sure all those kids fathers are not stuppid to buy their kids a 100 usd card so their kid can play i think big majority aims at budget cards like 1060 ,0,Aug-21

0, in the comments ive read about if you want an rtx 3070 an upper just go in a store and buy it in germany we have the uvp what the card should cost the rtx 3070 starts at 740 avg uvp 499 the rtx 3080 starts at 749 uvp 690 the rtx 3090 at 1 5k uvp 1 5k the 3060ti at 590 uvp 399 i dont know what your opinion is but i want to spent 600 and less for a gpu i also play vr and my 1070 served me well for that but i wont spent 140 more on a gpu thats overpriced cause nvidia doesnt get its shit together and block them softwarevise to stop opperationg in a bulk greater than 4 i also wont spend 200 and up for a xbox one x or playstation 5 cause ppl dont get enough money for me raytracing is a thing i wont miss in my vr experience right now there isnt any rtx game for vr but if there is one i will be ready idc about amd is better blablabla they are also out of stock or overpriced at our local sellers ,0,Dec-20
0, nvidia makes a cheaper and absolutely powerful rtx everyone causes them to sell out nearly instantly nvidia surprised pikachu face ,0,Sep-20
0, i want to play among us with rtx 3090 but the games keep on crashing so i wont buy it ,0,Sep-20
0, nvidia is definitely using this delay as a bid to increase demand but it could also mean better drivers on launch we'll just have to wait and see though ,23,Sep-18
0, i have a hard time understanding how this should be put as nvidia's fault from what i have read and watch on this matter it appears to look like aib partners decided to cheap out on the capacitors instead of following the spec am i missing a point here ,0,Sep-20
0, gif graphics interchange format so unless you say jraphics and not guh raphics it's gif with the g from girl end of discussion no arguments possible jif is wrong and we all know it d ,0,Aug-21
0, what i don't understand about radeon is when the 20 series cards were released everyone was complaining that the prices were insanely high and their excuse was ray tracing but now radeon is the same price as the low end rtx with pretty close performance and no rt so why is everyone still okay with the price 350 is the new standard for mid range even with no rtx ,0,Jul-19
0, question all i keep thinking about is amd still struggles to be on par with nvidia even when amd is on 7nm and nv is still on 12nm is there an explanation for this or does nv just have a much better architecture ,0,Jun-19
0, amd is shit they launched high end rdna cards in 2019 and now they launched high end rdna2 cards in 2020 while their entry level card is rx 570 which is polaris architecture and is years old and they launched only one new mid range card 5500xt and nothing else in my country 5500xt 4gb has same price as 1660 and 8gb version is expensive than 1660 super and 1650 super is cheaper than rx570 you know it's really fucked up when nvidia is cheaper one i'm building a pc next month with nvidia gpu ,0,Oct-20
0, nvidia does not care please tell me you didnt just figure that out when was the last time we didnt have to enter a raffle just to buy one or just be damn lucky for 1 to be in stock before covid it was the miners after covid it will be the miners again or maybe they will get more creative if these companies want to help people get their new gpus they could just go through their product registration for warranty and allow these people to upgrade their product if someone doesnt register their product then maybe start doing so but all they care about is the sales no matter how they get them thats just the harsh truth this is just 1 way we know there are many ways they can counter this bs they just chose not to im not forgetting about why there is a shortage right now but product scarcity was around before this global epidemic ,0,Aug-21
0, my du2 7970 3g is better then my du2 1060 6 gig the pascal throttle for sale dual gtx1060 6g not selling to biddy farmers bitfarmers in australia brisbane can see running would be a waste of your time offers below ,0,Aug-18

0, i found a 2060 super from zotac brand new for 700us i can get more if i buy a series x and still have money left over for a few games and get raytracing as well as some other popular graphics options just say no to what nvidia and amd are offering and stick to what you got or switch to consoles quite a bitter pill to swallow ,0,Sep-21

0, i've been wondering almost as long as i have known noctua's existence why they don't make either aftermarket kits or partnerships with gpu vendors i know some people bridge the gap by just zip tying noctua fans to their cards but it's too half assed a solution for me ,0,Aug-21
0, this is actually a good thing miners bought a shit ton of rx 580s they ended up selling used for less than half the price only issue is time so miners buying up gpus reducing the value of bitcoin enough to make minng worthless meaning a shitton of cards on the second hand market for dirt cheap but only 6 percent where miners so ehh maybe it won't happen this time no second hand rtx 3080 for 250 ,0,Nov-20

0, these crypto gpus aren't going to save us from the gpu apocalypse nvidia diverting a large portion of their dies to mining will cut into the gaming supply just as much they'll just sell the mining ones for 200 more and rip profits from the scalpers ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia is having real trouble ramping up production it seams or this rtx 300 series is a loss leader a product to get a shopper interested that was too good to be true production costs probably give a tiny if not negative profit margin they hope shoppers will buy the more profitable rtx 200 series and of course not buy amd ,0,Sep-20
0, well amd said that radeon vii will be limited production so who got it got it rest of people who wanted wait for navi rx 5900xt or new vega in 2020 maybe ,0,Jul-19
0, not sure if you guys will think its an alright idea but i feel like nvidia should do soething where you cant buy more than 2 or maybe just 1 and so to prevent botters they cant buy it if its using the same po box or address someone already used like i buy a card and since limit is 1 i pit in my address and i try to bypass by buying it then going for another one and it says something like you already used this addres or this address has been hsed something like that you know or the same card cant be used with the same address id do that tbh ,0,Sep-20

0, gpu pricing has been insane for a long time now couple of years back you could buy a good mid range gpu with 300 nowadays its 500 compared to console prices you get a whole system with a gpu price so no wonder why people wont buy any more pc parts and build systems because manufacturers have gotten way too greedy they are going to kill their own business ,0,Jun-18

0, personally i don't think nvdia is doing anything too bad wanting to not continue to endorse someone talking about traditional rasterization and wanting them talk more about raytracing makes sense to me they didn't say talk positively about raytracing but if you give someone a card for free and tell them to give their honest opinion about something specific that sounds fair to me ,0,Dec-20
0, so the rtx 3080 isn't nearly 2x the performance like they said the rtx 3090 is totally underwhelming and the rtx 3070 didn't show up on time looks like nvidia being their usual bullshitting selves ,0,Sep-20

0, the 70 series isn't a hot gpu it's the best nvidia gpu you get the definitively best performance to price ratio the 80 series is hardly better than the 70 on specs sheets in real world applications i bet 90 of people will absolutely never notice or benefit from those minuscule gains unless you're pushing your gpu to extremes like jayztwocents for the sake of pushing the cards to extremes then you get the 70 series at a price hardly more expensive then the 60 series it's official the 70 series is the best well apparently now relabled to 80 with the launch of the 300 generation ,1,Aug-21
0, them stopping driver support though won't stop you from using the card though nor fsr just stay on latest and last driver for em and ride it out ,0,Jun-21
0, that's a major reason too for inflated gpu prices if enough gpus were on the shelves at time of crypto craze we could be able to buy them at msrp or with discounts as said 'greed is the path to demolition ' now take the damage mofos ,0,Jun-18
0, nah just silly rumors it would be pointless to do a refresh homework sucks as does the timing of gpu releases when everyone is out of their jobs and broke lol ,0,May-20

0, wait the rx5500 will be low profil cat wait for it bc currently i'm building a livingroom pc mostly for multimedia stuff etc but when this card thets released the price for the older rx cards will drob ,0,Oct-19
0, in non rt or low rt games workloads the titan v will demolish the 2080 ti even the 1080 ti will beat the 2080 handily in current games which is why they launched the 2080 ti at the same time unless rt takes off very quickly these cards won't be worth it for a while unchanged memory capacity and marginal improvements in shading not great for double the price ,0,Aug-18
0, there are tons of shaders wich do the same thing and i don't need to buy nvidia's ultra expensive cards that are not really worth it ,0,Aug-19
0, why would you want to use freesync on an nvidia gpu you can use nvida fastsync for free which is superior and doesn't have any monitor requirements ,0,Aug-18
0, nvidia lets wait people spend more money whit 3080 and 3090 so they don't jump direct to the 3070 and we make less profit ,0,Sep-20
0, i just wish that vulcan was more popular doom ran like a dream on my gtx 950 thanks to it otherwise it would have run like shit vulcan is amazing ,0,Jan-19
0, what nvidia did was probably the smartest decision ever since miners literally win more money the more gpus they buy what reason would they have to stop buying so essentially the problem would never stop but like this both parts are happy you get an official and possibly more efficient gpu to mine cryptocurrency and the problem of stock in gaming gpus solves itself ,0,Feb-21
0, i totally love the fact that crypto is being adopted more and more by institutions and institutional investors walmart accepting crypto would be a huge step forward for sure whatever the case this is sure to continue to drive prices up which in turn makes mining more profitable luckily for gamers looking for gpus hopefully eth is just over the horizon so there should be a sharp drop in demand for gpus again hopefully thus driving prices down as second hand gpus used for ether mining flood the market ,0,Aug-21
0, amd they discontinued may be it will be a sweet spot with reduced price to performance comparing to new lineup or it may interfere with any card on the line up so they want it out of options who knows ,0,Jul-19
0, dear nvidia i am one of those gamers still waiting for gpu availability i care most about traditional rasterization ray tracing is not for me yet but i do like dlss so i'm probably still buying nvidia if i have to choose between 3080 and 6800xt at similar price eventually i'll switch to amd on rdna 3 or whatever in the future because i can't afford nvidia's enthusiast class gpu prices i respect myself too much to be taken advantage of again and again weeks ago i would have bought amd hands down but since there hasn't been any stock i bought a 4k 120hz tv and now i realize how much more necessary dlss would be had it not been for 4k i still think 1440p 165hz gaming is still the best sweet spot i still don't care about rtx until it completely blows me away i'd rather keep my fps than lose it ,0,Dec-20
0, well good luck to pros to get their hands on an rtx a600 or rtx a40 let alone a dozen or more needed for their companies lmfao ,0,Oct-20

0, i can finally upgrade to an rtx if cmp is released i hate those pesky miners buying out stocks of gpus ,0,Feb-21
0, maybe it was strategie of amd to put nvidia on the wrong foot with the price of navi and it was not a price cut but just the price al along ,0,Jul-19
0, no wonder people are getting crazy with the gpu shortages i know i am can't run shit on my apu ,2,May-21
0, as much as i want graphics card to return to normal i really don't like these limiters it artifically limits what i may want to do with my card besides gaming also i really don't like the hate crypto miners get we want to game they want to mine there is a supply and demand problem i am not going to sit here and say that my hobby is more important than theirs what i don't like about crypto mining is the power consumption and that is only from an environmental standpoint ,0,Apr-21
0, mmm no uefi support probably means no proper gpu passthrough in virtualization as well i'm guessing talking about dropping the ball ,0,Feb-19

0, imagine trying to control how people use their own hardware yeah nvidia arent good guys for doing this also humble bundle is going down the drain they decreased how much you can send to charity or to the devs ign ruins everything they touch ,0,Apr-21
0, gpu manufacturers should just ditch their distributors and carry out all the distribution throught lmg it will be tedious for the staff and seems pretty unrealistic and of course very slow but hypothetically actual gamers will get cards at msrp ,0,Mar-21
0, nvidia makes cards less convenient to mine on so miners won't buy them also nvidia continues to sell gaming cards directly to miners ,565,Apr-21

0, weird thing is hammer on box does cover rt numbers but they had the balls to say if you're not into rt or nvenc then the 6800 might be for you then they followed that up with a strong recommend for rtx 30 series if you are into those features their charts showed a clear advantage to nvidia with rt on just like everyone else's ,0,Dec-20
0, i've been waiting for someone to swoop in with noctua fans on their gpus for years which is exactly why i am not holding my breath for it to happen ,1,Sep-21
0, nvidia crippled the new gpus so miners cant mine but then robbed the die bin and slapped them on mining cards so miners can buy those at a markup but simultaneously gamers not only still will be missing the dies but will also not be able to casually mine while not gaming to maybe recoup some of the costs of the card nvidia triple fucked everyone learn the map chomos this isnt helpful to anyone but miners at a cost which they have money for serious miners ,0,Feb-21

0, btw apparently the rtx mobile gpus are going to give you way less performance compared to their desktop counterparts so do your research before buying just make sure you do it quickly as to not have to buy from scalpers ,0,Jan-21
0, the problem with the 30 series cooler is that the fan on the end of the gpu is facing downward suggesting it blows air to the bottom of the case that's bad design that's just gonna trap heat under the gpu they should both blow up with the second out to the top of the case ,0,Jun-20
0, well you have what you wanted if you want to be real gamer go nvidia amd is just a joke is finally true real gpu power belongs to nvidia also the pricey tag ,0,Oct-18

0, uneeded hardware cause there s not so fucking hungry software no game needs this extreme software to get some more fps if you knew what hardware and gaming companies what tricks they do to the games and the hardware so that you will go buy there new products you will lagh one is for sure all the games you see now in 2019 are not first released now that they say but before five years or so they first released in special internet cafes around the world and this is kind of kept secret to understand what im saying i finished dark souls 3 and sekiro before some years in a special internet cafe then after four five years i bought them also in the stores when they where first released to the public i know that cause all internet cafes back then had old games and only one had those titles i said dark souls 3 and sekiro destiny and destiny 2 and much more and the owner of the cafe told me as a secret that he bought the games that you the people will find them after some years like first released to the public cause his cafe is from the few in the world that can do that so games arent made and first released how they say they are now you know believe it or not is the truth about the games and i also i believe that the cards we are buying have much more power that they do but they dont let the card working freely like they locking it to work excactly i mean that if you know how to programming and making software you can really unlock the full potencial of the card mabe im wrong in that last but i think im not ,0,Jul-19

0, sorry but if a gpu can't stand being pushed to 100 constantly for hours without frying itself it's the gpu vendor's fault bad cooling bad firmware that controls cooling and clocks etc not the software game's fault mining crypto doesn't fry gpus and i'm very certain that mining pushes much more the gpus than just playing a random game blame whoever made that card not nvidia i'm sure their own reference cards are fine blame whoever made that specific card's cooling and firmware like msi asus gigabyte etc ,1,Jul-21

0, isnt nvidia selling only chips to crypto miners not full cards which would make the number of them sold much higher ie however many 3080 cards divides into 175 million the number of just raw chips would have to be closer to 3 times of more than that figure closer then to 750 00 to a million 3080s chips nvidia sold or maybe they are sending custom cards with no display ports etc but i thought big firns prefer just raw chips now ,0,Nov-20

0, fun ironic fact even when using the gpu's for mining the extra power use and lower hashrate would've still made it much more efficient to have bought amd's gpu's outright and force them out of the market that way maybe they'd even ended up selling a few of those returned units instead ,0,Jun-18

0, unhackable crypto limiters we're going to find out it's going to be easily hackable and somehow also backfire and cuck you on gaming performance and since they've split the silicon stock between geforce and their miner cards we're going to then deal with an even more limited supply of cards that are now worse for their primary intended use nvidia never change ,0,Feb-21
0, that sucks good thing i can't afford a 3080 anyway i really hope the incredible value of the rtx 3080 is reflected in the 3060 and 3070 as well and that they have figured out this scalping nonsense by then ,0,Sep-20
0, nvidia took the wrong approach if they wanted miners to buy their mining specific cards the mining specific cards are garbage in terms of mining efficiency compared to the regular rtx series cards so i don't see why miners would buy the mining specific cards unless the stocks of regular rtx cards have run dry as for the mining efficiency cap they're trying to introduce on the rtx3060 it'll fail miserably i give it a week before miners figure out a workaround once the capped drivers are released instead nvidia should've made those mining specific cards wildly more efficient than the current rtx series cards they should also mass produce those cards sell them to actual consumer level miners the previous run of mining specific cards nvidia made were 99 sold to bigtime mining farms so barely any of those mining specific cards made in into the hands of regular consumer level miners hence forcing those miners and there are alot to keep on buying up stocks of regular video cards let's hope they learned from their mistakes ,0,Feb-21

0, the only real solution unfortunately is to raise the price so high that miners can't profit from them easily it sucks but at least people who are willing to spend a lot for new gaming gpus can actually get them supply and demand the supply is very low and the demand is extremely high the price has to go up ,2,Feb-21

0, conspiracy theory nvidia deliberately launched the 30 series with crappy capacitors crapacitors because they knew that scalpers would get most of them so the scalpers will be selling shitty products that means that they'll get unpopular with their buyers and become completely untrusted and then the scalping industry as a whole will collapse in on itself heh i wish ,0,Sep-20
0, i guarantee that the drivers released by amd did not bring fsr support support is there regardless since it is there at game level and works on my nvidia 980 ti with old drivers i was hopeful for amd fsr and somewhat disappointed in my testing fsr is just resolution scaling with radeon image sharpening i tried with amd 5700xt and sapphire trixx software on 1440 monitor i set the resolution scale percent to 77 1440 to 1105 which nearly matches fsr ultra 1440 to 1108 if i have radeon image sharpening on the fps and quantity looks the same as fsr ultra if i have radeon image sharpening off the resolution scaling has higher fps but the image is not as clear the radeon image sharping seem to have almost the exact same fps overhead as fsr resolution scaling works in all games fsr works in games that dev will specifically support the only benefit i think exist is that if the developers add fsr then it applies the sharpening before post processing effects this could help reduce some artifacts on effects such as film grain or other post processing effects ,0,Jun-21

0, i may be an idiot but could someone please explain to me how nvidia rereleasing the 2060 will combat the gpu shortage i'd imagine they'd still have the same amount of resources to put towards building gpus and i'd imagine a 2060 takes pretty much as long to make as any other gpu to make so wouldn't their gpu output be the same ,1,Sep-21

0, so what anthony just described the best amd gpu currently would be the radeon 7 with a water block instead of trying to air cool it good shit to know dont know why they dont just say that though and instead dog it ,0,Jul-19
0, wtf they should drop their prices sooner rather than continue selling pascal next year i think there are two reasons one is amd amd cards remain expensive as they are still viable for mining so retailers cannot drop prices of nvidia cards similar or less than amd cards second reason i think gamers are continuously buying nvidia cards so there is no pressure to drop prices to msrp ,0,Jun-18
0, nvidia i've been telling this all along the dumbest company to buy from first with crapworks and now they just implement ray tracing and dlss to try and scoop amd out of gpu's don't forget the gpp and the g sync compatible monitor story where all monitors get g sync compatible on it and not a mention of freesync and now the hardware unboxed thing open your eyes people there just pushing ray tracing like they pushed gameworks nothing more i'm not saying there gpu's are crap but they just want a monopoly and don't say rtx 3090 is a titan when it was supposed to be a ti replacement but they screwed up with the 3090 so hard they just wanted to see if they could get away with another cash influx from 1200 to 1500 but thats my opinion ,0,Dec-20
0, i had to settle for a radeon 5500xt still a significant upgrade from a gtx 590 but man an rtx woulda been nice if they exsisted ,0,Jan-21

0, so the shortage of gpus was just a lie to inflate the prices with no real reason who would have guessed that ,81,Jun-18
0, you wouldn't believe how useful those old gpus can be when gaming is not the primary need or power is a factor the lack of support is why we upgrade but it's nice to have something that is still supported ,0,Jan-21
0, rumored leaked prices usd 3060 399 3070 599 3080 800 3090 1300 ridiculous if this is true way to go and kill budget pc gaming nvidia an entry level card or a medium spec card should never cost more than a basic entry console or a high performance console this is gonna turn a lot of entry level pc builders towards the new high performance consoles and keep a lot of current pc builders from upgrading for a while simply because its no longer going to be cost effective to build a pc rather than buy a console gg nvidia ,1,Aug-20
0, how about nvidia helps reduce the stupidly high prices by selling them at half the current prices demand is still high i think ,0,Jun-18
0, everyone just needs to calm down about the rtx cards and wait for actually benchmarks from independent testers the 1080 has been around for ages whats a few more weeks also don't preorder ever btw its pretty hypocritical to put a preorder video right after you encourage people never to preorder ,0,Aug-18
0, sorry for being an idiot but i know almost nothing about pc building and i want to know is the rtx series only good for raytracing or dose it also perform extremly good for gaming thx ,0,Aug-18
0, 1440p 120fps at 300 is actually a really fucking good deal a pc that can run that will cost more than 300 just for the gpu ,0,Sep-20
0, honestly all the miners aren't even concerned we'll switch to another algo when eth is dead and nvidia's limiter doesn't work on those so it's still worth a look at the 'limited hash rate' cards as a miner nvidia wasting it's money on this needless engineering worth it for the publicity ,0,May-21
0, imagine if nvidia tried to remaster crysis nobody would be able to run it for another 5 10 years they would be too preoccupied on whether or not they could and didn't stop to think if they should ,0,Oct-19

0, nvidia drops rtx cards on market consumers what the fuck is this i'm waiting for the next cards sticking with my 10 series ti cards ,0,Aug-18
0, are all these gpu skus just a side product of the main products like nvidia has a stock of under overperforming chips that didn't make it into an end product and to get use out of those they just release new gpus ,0,Aug-21
0, the new amd cards look better than nvidias 300 series imo i like the traditional axial fan design more not to mention we have classical 2x 8pin connectors ,2,Nov-20

0, don't shame a new low profile card the heck i'm excited for it the gt710 got revamped last year too it's great ,0,Jan-21
0, you do realize they have some high pixel count texture packs right yeah still blocky but things like the very old now sphax packs were 1024 2048 tiles way back in the day when tekkit was new a high res tex pack with rtx would probably look pretty damn good but there have been addons that gave good lighting for years as well so this isn't that big of an improvement to those either p i mean if you just play on console you might not know any better but addons have made minecraft a lot better looking and a resource hog for what a decade now ,1,Aug-19
0, so glad i got my gpu in january so disappointed the new system has less than 10 hours of use since first post ,0,Aug-21
0, was kinda shitty of you guys to use pictures of the founders edition in the video and the thumbnail since the problem seems to exist with the partner cards instead ,0,Sep-20
0, since scalpers and miners are such a problem together i'd suggest this make the gaming cards unable to perform any type of mining or cripple it to such degree it's not worth it force the miners to buy the dedicated compute cards instead ,0,Nov-20
0, you're wrong many content creators would love these i for one need vram way more than the fastest gpu as the opencl stuff i do rarely uses the gpu more than at 25 30 but errors out if i run out of vram ,0,Sep-21
0, as someone who mostly plays skyrim and fallout i just want a gpu with more than 16 gb of vram but companies don't want to give us that ,0,Sep-21
0, the problem is not with the miners but with nvidia and amd that can never keep up with demand when a new gpu releases not a single time i remember when a new gen was not sold out for months ,0,Dec-20
0, this was part of the whole plan by nvidia their prices are so low to stay competitive but theyre artificially upping demand by dumping cards to cryptofarms as soon as they get enough batches keeping purchase prices high for aibs theres no way they could sustain rtx 3070s already slim profit margin without them doing this and they get away with shady stuff like this ,2,Nov-20
0, wtf is a 2060 going to do with all that vram it's not like it has a gpu powerful enough to play at 4k shit it's just another mining card isn't it ,0,Sep-21
0, if game engine support ray tracing natively this might not end up being just another nvidia gimmick still waiting for amd's take on it tho ,0,Feb-19
0, i totally agree with nvidia most reviewers out there only make fun of everything and condemn every product out there to make money and fool ignorant people who look to you all for help and advice shame on you all just look how you all reacting to this cant you just buy a card to condemn it ,0,Dec-20
0, some board maker hoards gpus while we're suffering a gpu shortage then nvidia buys the surplus my laptop died in march and i had to pay double for a video card because of the shortage you've all seen pictures of empty shelves where disappointed people like me hoped to find a video card for their new computer here's mine url no sympathy from me ,0,Jun-18
0, im not concerned with graphics cards until legislation is introduced to force companys to use systems that protect consumers against scalpers this situation has thrown card prices out of whack ,0,Sep-21
0, still glad that nvidia took one for the team and made gpu prices lower in turn forcing amd to lower prices as well ,0,Oct-20
0, well at least miners will stick with their fresh ampere cards so the love whatever cards can be left for us gamers and other professionals right ,0,Dec-20
0, even if their plan did work you guys all have to realize its still the wrong move and they dont actually care about us gamers companies should never put artificial limits in their hardware in the first place no matter what their intentions are and also realize nvidea doesnt care who buys their cards they only car that they are getting bought off the shelves and theyre making money also realize after the miners are done with them they do to the second hand market a lot of the time anyway for really cheap ,0,Mar-21
0, why don't amd and nvidia kill the mining performance of all of their cards then make mining specific cards only for themselves they'd be rich ,0,Mar-21
0, wow i was actually interested in an actually modern cheap passively cooled video card but i guess they just don't want my money ,0,Jan-21

0, the verbiage for your micro center story is a little off that is actually the current system that the managers at the dallas micro center have been using previously they allowed people to camp overnight but people were peeing on the side of the building smoking weed and starting fires so now no one is allowed on the property until a m at a m you're supposed to run to the wall to form a line this has been going on every day for the last 2 weeks personally i think this new system is more dangerous but better than the last one because there's a scalper people call carlos that would pay people 200 a card to camp outside the micro center every time dallas had a drop the first 20 to 30 cards would go to carlos ,4,May-21
0, for the 3060 ti i was waiting for 9am refreshed the page of multiple stores none of them had the card available before or so and even there it all disappeared before i could even see one in stock even though i refreshed every 10 seconds or so it went from available soon to out of stock between two refresh ,0,Nov-20

0, fuck nvidia the bastards holding this many gpu chips could have been really good in bringing down the cost of gpu's they are so stingy about giving chips out because they want to keep their product limited and to have a perception of it being so superior and that it must be good if it is always sold out and the prices are inflated i mean why make enough chips to keep the cost steady and still make a profit when you can make half the chips and make 3x the profit ,0,Jun-18
0, prediction the lhr card will not only be hackable it will be the fastest mining card ever or something like that ,1,Apr-21

0, the gov needs to make it illigal to sell cards over mrsp price then we win the miners are a small problems its poor ppl who are greedy selling things over 2x the cost give high fines and jail time ,0,Apr-21
0, as long as the new radeon gpu is in the same power range as a 1080 or slightly better they will snag a significant share of the market most people arent willing to pay the premium of the rtx series ,0,Sep-18
0, one thing i noted from the scarlett specs was the raytracing on navi comment yet the 5700xt card doesn't seem to have it strange that amd put rt into the console chiplets but not their 'pushing the limits' pc gpu ,0,Jun-19
0, this needs to happen again and again companies like nvidia are far too big the 'mergers' need to end they are a threat to freedom and sovereignty everywhere ,0,Apr-21
0, nvidia may have made around billion in gpu sales but most of that probably comes from datacenter sales so if you are only talking about gaming gpus cryptominers did get much more than 6 of sales ,0,Nov-20
0, trumps site being hacked is not a surprise now to see if biden will also see the same fate the new gpu announcements are promising as well these kinds of performance jumps will be nice especially now that we have competition ,1,Oct-20

0, so in short amd's onboard radeon vega graphics on 200 300 and 400 series apus will perform better after all that's what's being used in gaming consoles ,0,Nov-20
0, regarding 30 series vram that's a genuine concern if the 3080 has 10gb the 3070 will have 8gb and the 3060 just 6gb the nvidia mid range has been offering 6gb since pascal it was cheeky on turing but still sticking to 6gb on ampere is just a really bad move i figure they're trying to keep the cost down but as is it's not hard to saturate all that let alone in next few years with the expected generation bump ,0,Aug-20
0, hey isn't that the same style of presentation star citizen used way back hell even the graphics look like they're from sc then again prices and target audience are similar so it might not be that surprising ,0,Aug-21

0, hmm cant really blame nvidia tho for aibs using cheaper capacitors the reference pcb shows it requires the expensive capacitor cluster ,0,Sep-20
0, amd still write shitty drivers and software compare to nvidia really rooting for team red as i switched from gtx 1080 to a vega 56 but what can i say i'm not going to talk about frame rate or raw performance but nvidia just give a smoother experience with less hassles less kinks less crashes amd seems to be a little better with multi monitor but other than that nvidia has better compatibility and overall smoothness of operation the average person do not have patients with driver updates bug fixes etc they just want stuff to work things will not improve until amd spend more on their software engineers ,0,Jul-19

0, why didnt nvidia fix this umm because like you said it is nothing to do with nvidia and everything to do with 3rd party card makers ,0,Sep-20
0, honestly it's probably better just to wait for an inevitable crypto crash and then buy a card if you desperately need a gpu used pascal cards are probably the safest affordable option unless you're a streamer that makes real money playing the latest games you really don't need the latest and greatest cards ,0,Feb-21
0, i payed 400 for my 1070 new i don't care about ray tracing or hash rates i'm not paying that much for a card these prices are gonna make switch to console ,0,Sep-21

0, i like how y'all say that stadia wasn't actually 4k it was just upscaled to 4k isn't that what dlss does everybody talks about how that's the greatest thing since sliced bread like you said it's still not true 4k don't pick on stadia when you give nvidia credit for it ,0,Feb-21

0, smh i just want to get my hands on a gpu at retail price even the 20 series are overpriced ,1,Apr-21
0, 175 00 00 at 700 a pop would be roughly 250 00 cards that went to cryptocurrency mining maybe nvidia should launch a specific card dedicated to that that is more expensive that would leave the rest of us with enough stock to not want to switch to amd ,0,Nov-20

0, well arm with nvidia would just make more real competition lol they scared now you want south korea to rule world or china tiwaan hmm ,0,Feb-21
0, imo professional miners are going to find work arounds for this move and it will really only affect the pleb that wants to mine when they are not gaming i seriously doubt it will do anything but upset a lot of people and the stock problem will continue i think if nvidia can enforce it allow only one sale per address if you want more than one i suppose you can buy one from every aib but every aib could have their own database and do like evga and allowing a que system and not sell drop shipments until the que is empty ,0,Feb-21

0, i feel like nvidia just used those 300k graphics card for a couple years and have a shit ton of bitcoins ,0,Jun-18
0, the rtx limiter is unfortunately nothing new hardware manufacturers have long been working out ways to limit what people can do with the hardware after they purchased it to sell other hardware with identical or nearly identical specs at inflated prices or in the server and professional arena they do software licensing built into the firmware of the hardware itself to further nickle and dime business customers like how sas raid cards can require a license to use sas drives and no license means it's sata only that is nothing new but this is the first time i remember it being done in a way that could be viewed as an attempt to help consumers with the shortage of product graphics cards in this case and that can have more unfortunate side effects that'll burn consumers rights to their own hardware down the road ,0,Feb-21

0, what the hell even is that gpu it looks like a dreamscape approximation of what your brain loosely sees as a gpu at a distance in the fog squinting even then it's not particularly acurate it looks more like a sound card or a sound card with quite possibly the worst fan shroud i've ever seen placed ontop haphazardly like a poorly fitted toupe ,0,Jan-21

0, that 1660 naming scheme though i called it a month ago kinda rtx launched well overpriced according to most people and i agree now the 10 series is discontinued and all that's left is an overpriced 20 series with some remains of the reasonably priced 10 series left and to hide that price hike the naming scheme is changed like this 1660 sounds like a very different beast to a 1060 than a 1160 i still think that's the actual reason and it kinda fits with their questionable explanation ,0,Feb-19

0, how long for the 3090 super ti don't forgot the new 1500 watt power supply cost and high refresh 4k monitor like the lg 27gn950 b 700 for the 3080fe is reasonable 1200 for the 3080ti feels pretty crazy and 1500 should seem crazy for the 3090 i can't wait to watch bots buy 3090 supers for 2k or more it honestly feels like gpus are testing the limits of profitability on the supply demand curve especially with aib chips cards going for hundreds more than the already pricy fe cards ,0,Aug-21
0, let's be real the whole rate racing thing is pretty cool but right now we are all expected to pay for them trying to integrate it further into games that will be out in the future if they really want to impress gamers they need to either give us performance numbers for what it will do beyond the previous generation and also talk about how the new cards will impact mobile gaming mobile gaming with powerful gpus are starting to take a much larger share of the market spend two hours talking about what consumers want not trying to convince us that we need something else ,0,Aug-18

0, as per moores law is dead i think that nvidia pulling fe cards from their store is a way to slowly phase out that model it's manufacturing cost is too high and can't be sold at msrp it's only goal was to make day one reviews look better ,1,Oct-20
0, wtf does nvidia have against ethereum idiots seriously tho they should stop creating ewaste by mining gpus which miners will only use for like a year before throwing away because gamers cant use them i hope amd shows them how it should be done ,0,Feb-21
0, im very good at finding monopolistic tactics and i dont find that valve is making them its easy make a f im store with the same features as base overlay with browser and chat store with good rating system that lets you see how others have rate it and let them comment about game library let people choose where to install the game and very important let users move the games to another drive or folder after the fact if you look what ive said youll see that platforms like epic games store are half baked right now and should invest more in getting a fully functional and featured store the only store that i see quite on the same level is gog have most of the same features plus drm free policies and the client is optional you can change location of games but in my opinion is not well documented or explain you can simply cut and paste the game folder to other location and later tell the gog client that you want to import games and tell it to look for previously installed games in x folders and it will recognize it and youll have it again but in other location the only feature i miss in gog is not having a browser in the overlay but now i have an amd gpu and the drivers overlay have one gog even has an integrated fps counter as steam ,0,Apr-21

0, jay did a great episode yesterday about the gpu issue it looks like most of the board partners have tried to cheap out and use the absolute lowest requirements given to them from nvidia for the 3080's to run which is fine for there standard clock but once they start turbo boosting the capacitors can't keep up ,0,Sep-20
0, nvidia sold a ton of cards to miners but about all the other 3rd party manufacturers did evga msi asus all sell off their inventory to miners as well or did they all not full understand the demand of some of the best cards on the market in multiple generations and the fact a ton of people are stuck in a crappy pandemic with nothing else better to do ,0,Nov-20

0, not really etherium classic is actually dropping the dag size to allow 3g and 4g cards to mine again and as for etherium it will be hitting the 4g mark making 4g cards not able to mine on dec 23rd all the navi cards are 6g so are able to mine still and are very efficient at it but the 300 series are looking pretty efficient as well and that's a key go to for miners ,0,Nov-20

0, i dont get why this is being dissed i struggled for ages trying to find the cheapest possible card with a display port output for my media pc and eventually found a rx 550 2 gb for 53 i would have rather had an nvidia one as i use a g sync monitor but the gt 1030 was 70 without display port output assuming that this gt 1010 also includes a display port output it has a market for non gaming pcs still rocking a pentium g4560 with 8 gb ram and a 2gb rx 550 for my backup pc and surprisingly it even runs baldurs gate 3 on medium settings 720p at 30 fps ,0,Jan-21
0, i dont mine and i dont like miners but i still dont like the concept of artifially limited the capabilities of hardware i paid for just doesnt sit well to me also im not sure i undertstand how this will actually help increase stock availability for gaming gpu's now you are just gauranteeing that half the gpu chips can not be used for gaming as they will go into mining dedicated cards its not like they are different gpus same gpus same stock issues at least before we had a chance of buying them if all the planets aligned etc etc but now for half that gpu stock we simply cannot at all as they dont even have hdmi out etc they are only for miners im just not sure i see how this helps also i really want rtx3080's to be available and at least near msrp this whole situation sucks but i am happy to wait up to another year if they are still not affordable available well yeah that will seriously suck i will lose my shit lol ,0,Feb-21

0, anyone complaining about nvidia doing this is part of the problem it's one thing to do what you want with the hardware you own but getting that hardware through backdoor deals and bots to mine crypto is the root of the problem now there's something dedicated to mining instead of wasting engineering and manufacturing goods for a use its not actually intended for ,0,Feb-21

0, to anyone thinking about buying crypto if you are you are funding the miners that buy up all these gpus and you are fucking up our planet simultaneously so please don't do it ,1,Apr-21
0, well i'd imagine in a ray tracing game it actually might improve the fps using the dedicated parts of the gpu for its purpose lighting freeing up other parts to do normal computations and not lighting i could just be blowing smoke depending on how ray tracing works in the backend i'm not going to preorder mostly because of that 400 premium in the 2080ti atm i will be getting one though regardless my 670 isn't exactly current ,0,Aug-18
0, i would feel a little bit let down by ltt if they continue to take products pre launch from nvidia they should impose on themselves the same situation hwunbox is in just to make a statement since they're literally one of the only ones in the industries that can afford to not to presume their finances ,0,Dec-20

0, tbh not a fan of the nvidea deal at the cost of the super dooper graphics update they cancelled it because it didn't perform well across a multitude of devices whilst rtx only works with rtx cards and sonic ether made path tracing shaders that works on every gpu whether amd or nvidea and tbh it also looks a lot better not saying you'll have a good framerate tho ,1,Aug-19

0, i feel like nvidia is building a super monopoly but they're just doing it in a sector that no one understands so they'll get away with it ,0,Sep-20
0, so by looking at this from an econical stand point this is fantastic for consumers with a massive supply of gpus prices for them have to fall in order to meet the supply demand curve so for people needing a new graphics card wait a couple weeks and prices should fall that is unless nvidia's accountants are morons and don't understand simple economics ,0,Jun-18
0, maybe their linking integrated gpus protocol is how they're going to make their first gen dedicated gpus they'll just put a bunch of modules onto a board and link them ,0,Dec-19

0, i think the old cards are kinda overlooked in this the rx570 580 and 590 are still on sale at fairly low prices and nvidia's gtx 1650 1660 have completely failed to make a product obsolete which they competed against with the previous generation gtx 1060 already ,0,Jul-19

0, miners also don't want mining only cards because they can't turn around and sell them to people wanting a gaming card after it's obsolete for mining 1080s and 1080ti cards still sell for a hefty price used especially the ti variants due to miners if those cards were mining only those miners would be stuck with them ,0,Feb-21
0, i think for the foreseeable future that the newest generation of graphics cards are always going to get snapped up by miners and scalpers with bots vast majority of consumers will be stuck at least a generation behind what is released from now on on used cards that spent their first year mining 24 7 too far too much real and crypto money to be made id bet the graphics chip makers get in on it before too long 3060 ti will be known as the last affordable graphics card relative to performance vs previous generation ,0,Dec-20

0, navi 23 looks like it will be a solid lower midrange competitor around the level of the rtx 2080 rtx 2080 might be lower midrange next gen sounds completely crazy but it's likely to happen if you consider all the evidence we have so far about how good rdna2 is and do some calculations based on cu count no wonder there were rumours of navi 23 being an nvidia killer we'll have to see how the rtx 3060 and 3050 ti compete ,0,Nov-20

0, a they wait for enough cards in stock to prevent rtx 3080 fiasco b waiting for amd release c both most likely ,0,Sep-20
0, i like the idea of a push fan and a pull fan on either side of the card at opposite ends as it seems but if they do that i think they should allow the ability to change each fans rotation direction so people can make their fans run more efficient according to the case like air out the top or bottom also can nvidia finally allow third party board makers to have titan boards like come on i like my ti cards but the titans are even better and the stock cooler and shroud hampers it thermally compared to other coolers ,0,Jun-20

0, nvidia's plan is to sell a lot of gpu period why lmg thinks nvid must sell to gamers is whack nvid can sell to whoever they want if they sell everything they make which they do then they win they're doing what they're supposed to do like sfw if miners buy them up don't like it buy another brand i say it this forcefully because lmg fans think they have this right to those cards but you don't they don't belong to you they belong to nvidia boycott go ahead someone else will get in line at 2 am for the card you will cry about not having ,0,Feb-21

0, nvidia's raytracing is insignificant and should not even be considered a factor when comparing the two cards oh we got this new gimmicky feature that hardly even works on like three games no not sure what you were thinking at ,0,Feb-19
0, first of all the cap issue doesn't happen to the fe cards because nvidia didn't skimp on their caps secondly nvidia made their custom card based on the same reference card they gave to all the aibs so it's not on nvidia to fix anything the third party people fucked themselves by skimping out on the capacitors and not putting in a proper speed ceiling in the stock firmware to protect the card which they'll probably put out an update for this was made clear by jayz2cents days ago so you're either way under researched or being willfully ignorant just so that you can make a baiting thumbnail and title ,2,Sep-20

0, i hope they launch with supers ti directly fir the simple reason that that means they have a bigger gap between 3070 and 3080ti that needs to be filled with cards so we may see a large jump on the most expensive card ,0,Jul-20

0, that is 250 00 two hundred and fifty thousand nvidia 3080s its even more of a reason to not support nvidia this is a pretty low blow to normal consumers they gave miners first pick and preference because they have a stake in the crypto currency market anti consumerism is strong in this brand stop defending them not only should this be first come first serve they also need to build in functionality for one per customer 3080 and below and two per customer for 3090 for sli so bots can not buy them up until full production is ramped up i called nvidia out on their lie of no shortage 6 months before the cards released they are full of bs i wonder what lie jensen will cook up next miners stole them not guilty ,0,Nov-20

0, i talked to a guy from microcenter he told me that people who dont get a 3080 just buy a 3090 instead i can only assume that nvidia is keeping stock limited to fake scarcity and get more people to shell out for a 3090 because if everybody had access to a 3080 very few would buy the 3090 ,0,Sep-20

0, miner here with a big discord of other miners we aren't buying current gen hardware roi isn't worth it rx 580 570 8gb and 5700 are popping up like nuts on the used market and we're grabbing them for our mining operations don't worry about us buying new cards there's plenty of used stuff going around for us right now ,0,Nov-20
0, its easy to pre order when they haven't and won't charge my card until they actually ship it by then all you kind of guys that get samples before everyone else will be either gushing about how amazing the 2080ti is and why it's a necessity to buy or that it's crap in which case i cancel my pre order before it ships so not really as problem ,0,Aug-18
0, software shouldnt be depended on for limiting the hardware the hardware should keep itself in check i imagine this is mostly an issue from nvidia probably related to the weird power draw spikes in the 30 series much praise to evga for making sure gamers get replacements even though its probably mostly nvidias fault ,1,Jul-21

0, the noctua gpu fan thing won't really improve your load temps unless they also improve the heatsink there's a reason deshrouding and placing 120mm fans cool better than stock ,0,Aug-21
0, this will mean if there no significant improvements people that got a 1060 or rx 480 on or close to release could have to wait nearly 4 years for a meaningful upgrade unless the 2060 card will be worth a upgrade its almost as long as a console generation or a console refresh model ,0,Sep-18

0, i don't mind the business decision to cripple gaming gpus for mining if they were actually solving the problem for gamers which is the supply shortage if they can't deliver enough gaming gpus to meet demand they won't be able to deliver enough mining gpus what happens when the miners run out of mining gpu stock to buy they will end up buying the gaming ones anyway ,0,Feb-21
0, the drivers for these cards would also not be optimised when they are first launched so may as well just wait awhile before you pick them up ,0,Aug-18
0, ltt never preorder however allowing preorders can give retailers a measure what the demand will look like the fact that nvidia didn't allow pre orders before launch meant the people who wanted to pre order resorted to bots ,0,Sep-20

0, if they really wanna stop the crypto miners buying gaming cards they have to sell a cheaper card with higher hash per watt so the gaming cards are unappealing ,4,Feb-21
0, i really wish that nvidia would stop trying to gimp the devices that they want people to buy they should be working to improve the performance usability and reliability for their products for whatever their customers want to use them for the workload should be completely up to the customer no company should have a limiter for what their hardware can do this is just bs ,0,Apr-21

0, 2500 for a 4k camera monitor is flipping cheap not to mention the 4g 5g connectivity for live streaming those two things seperately are going to cost 300 each significantly more for 4g 5g streaming of video because that used to require a dedicated laptop capture card and hotspot ,0,Jan-21

0, if you want to increase availability to the general public you have to limit it nvidia direct sales only anti bot measures such as captcha this would do wonders for e tailers it's why all the cards get snatched up in a matter of seconds multi factor identity verification ssi and photo id requirements etc 1 2 per person you can put limiters on the cards all you want but unless you actually implement measures to make it difficult for miners to acquire large quantities of cards then we're not getting anywhere ,0,Apr-21

0, hahaha xbox lol current one x can barely handle 1080p at a solid 60fps on most games it will be the third generation of inflated misleading numbers upscaling is not even comparable especially if you have to sacrifice smooth gameplay and graphical fidelity for it and natively has never been over 30fps on low medium settings i have a xbox one x and most the time i'd rather game on my pc because itsn't dipping and diving any chance it gets maybe if they asked devs to develop games that run well instead of look pretty they might reach these numbers but as long as they are over reaching the hardware it will always be an annoying experience to think all they'd have to do is offer user settings so we can choose performance over superfluous post processing and effects that the system can barely even handle edit i can't believe how many years it's taken consoles to reach just 1080p at 60fps and it's not even system wide pc gaming has allowed 1080p 60fps for 10 years easily which should be the bare minimum experience ,0,Jun-19

0, it really shows how badly nvidia has distorted the graphics card market that people find it hard to believe that a card with rtx 2070 performance i e about gtx 1080 and vega 64 could be sold for 340 that's a high price for that performance a vega 64 can be had for 400 new right now and with a bit of undervolting is about the same performance as the rtx 2070 with hbm2 memory honestly there's nothing remotely unbelievable about a navi card for 340 that matches the rtx 2070 this year the only surprising thing about that is that the price is that high they should be able to do it for under 300 which is the proper price point for that level of performance in 2019 ,0,May-19

0, video idea for you guys please see if its possible to get nvidia 3d vision yes its deprecated but see if it works on an expensive gsync oled big format gaming display bfgd or just the state of 3d vision in 2021 and look at helixmods 3d fix application a community actively providing 3d support or fixes for new games ,0,Sep-21

0, 300 series card litterally just boost power consumption to reach the amount of performance it has now they ditch the power efficiency idea so it will hurt the performance if they turn it into low power mobile chip ,0,Jan-21

0, so basically buy a bunch of gpus now at mrsp then wait a week for the limiter to be hacked ,0,Apr-21
0, as a miner we will never buy mining cards unless they are dirt cheap the reaon is roi if i have 100 3080s in 3 years when the 4080 drops i can sell all of my 3080s for a good return vs the mining cards that wont sell well at all ,0,Mar-21

0, yeah amd's card will be crushed in all those wonderful games with raytracing only thing supported less than vulkan is raytracing ,0,Jan-19
0, clearly at the top end the amd is way better bang for your buck what about the lower end 3070 vs xt 6800 is the amd worth 80 us more the game i will use as a benchmark is fs2020 not sure if i will go 4k or 1440p defiantly tine to upgrade my aging gtx 1070 rig ,0,Nov-20
0, well my 1080 gtx cost me 2400 israeli shekels which was 600 dollars 3 years ago a 3060 is more than k now while a 3080 is 6k ils now 1800 fun fact a 1080 is still better than a 3060 ,0,Sep-21
0, so it has been reported that there are stability issues with these new cards from nvidia because of cheap capacitors not to mention inferior cooling from the aib designs and on top of it all now it could even be a os specific issue with windows ill never think another bad thing about any of amds launches ever again ,0,Sep-20
0, well i hope elon musk also starts a freaking silicon fab because now because of him the freaking miners will continue to buy more graphics cards since btc is on the rise again and thus the gpu shortage continues he seems to be sort of turning into an evil villain doesn't he ,0,Jun-21

0, glad i chose amd radeon graphic card over nvidia i'll stick with windows 7 for a bit longer thank you ,0,Jun-21
0, i was super excited about the nvidia allowing use of gpus in vm's until i realized it was just passthrough and not what i thought it was which is allowing virtual machines to be accelerated by the underlaying os's gpu vdi style which they force you to get a quadro for because nvidia hates consumers i want to be able to run linux on my desktop for day to day tasks but be able to fire up a gpu accelerated windows vm in order to play games work in proprietary windows only apps like the adobe suite etc with full vm isolation my job pretty much requires me to use premiere and i'm an avid player of video games but linux games support while significantly improved in recent years still doesn't offer the same compatibility as windows does particularly for legacy applications ,0,Mar-21
0, my issue with keyboard mouse vs controller is the keyboard i can admit mouse is better than analog but keyboard is majorly inconvenient for gaming from buttons being in bad places i shouldnt have to spend 10 minutes on every game update to remap to something somewhat sensible and movement is locked at either move it or not with some games offering a 20 or 50 movement when pressing another key at the same time as walking that is inconveniently placed in a hard to press location so i would absolutely love to try that nvidia controller ,0,Jan-21

0, i'd like to have seen you guys at least mention sonicether's minecraft shaders that use directx's raytracing setup directly it actually seems to look much better than nvidia's rtx version and is playable on my gtx1080 running pretty well too d ,0,Aug-19
0, how is it not true the rtx 2060 is 350 and it's within 10 15 of a 2070 if the 2070 is overpriced it doesn't mean that everything else has to be i would be a bit disappointed if they only gave us rtx 2060 performance plus like 10 15 for the same price as a 2060 ,0,May-19
0, im probably going to be getting a pc around october time selling my xbox and switch because they never get used hope rdna2 is cheaper than rtx cos nvidia really be dropping the ball on prices that or i'm hoping for some crazy price drops ,0,Jun-20

0, if only nvidia and amd would release one type of graphic card dedicated to mining and lock this ability on the rest of them it would be great ,0,Feb-21
0, all that money spent on a card that gets fried if it's worked too hard you think the card can handle it or maybe nvidia brought the card out too soon before it can be fully tested ,0,Jul-21
0, i think the problem with minecraft rtx is that the game starts to lag like crazy if there's a lot of npcs even you have a beast of a machine you can see this in pewdiepies videos for example when he breeds a crap ton of pigs i have a 6700k and a 1080 and i run the game on pretty much the lowest settings because the performance isn't stable otherwise ,0,Aug-19
0, dearnvidia ray tracing who cares your speech was like launching a new car and saying it can do an altitude of 10 00 metres where my previous car was doing kilometres per litre and kilometres per hour how do i even compare what's the real time speed what are the outputs on the back side and basically what's the speed vs your own previous generation cards nvidia rtx ,0,Aug-18

0, makes sense to try and limit mining on non mining gpus the less mining done by regular people the lower the supply of coins coming into the market the longer the boom will likely last and when the boom is over those mining cards won't go flooding the second hand market eliminating a cheap upgrade path for people now if only their was some way to separate the gaming and productivity markets too some nvidia executive probably ,0,Apr-21
0, yeah they're coming out with new 300s gpu's because no one seems to want to buy the 200 series at least the 200 series will be more affordable ,0,Apr-20

0, nvidia rtx a600 a40 that crazy professional stuff crysis 3 installed on rtx 3090 vram i didn't know that you could do that ,0,Oct-20
0, if they run at 8k at 120hz then dont expect any graphical improvements over last gen this is why theyre pushing higher resolutions because then they dont have to put more effort into graphical fidelity its a complete con make the hardware do the work by rendering higher resolutions rather than making devs create higher graphical fidelity which would cost more money ,0,Jun-19
0, serves them right never did anything to control mining greedy bastards they could have put in a firware to prevent mining well now eat em all by yourself nvidia ,0,Jun-18
0, nvidia just assured that after the mining bubble bursts the mining gpus won't compete with their gaming gpus so their prices won't drop and will remain elevated so we that were expecting a lower price after the mining boom are f ed ,0,Feb-21
0, they opened up for exploits in ring0 with their previous miner block there is now possible to edit settings in their firmware at runtime thus making anything they now do meaningless it also means surfing the net will become dangerous all cards using the 4 version drivers when it becomes common knowledgeable what the exploit is ,0,Apr-21
0, i guess there won't be chromebooks with gaming laptops as chrome os uses wayland and nvidias attitude towards that has been hostile or at least passive aggressive or maybe we'll see some improvement from there being a financial incentive to not be assholes ,0,Apr-21
0, apart from the highest sku all new mining cards are really renamed old pascal p106 p104 and p102 you can compare hashrates and power usage these are essentially same 3 year old cards with new names also 3060 works very well on other algos only eherium mining is nerfed these cards are already sold out for 2 3x msrp and are already mining ,0,Feb-21
0, why doesn't nvidia stop teaming up with manufacturers to try to scam people into giving more money for higher end laptop gpus that don't even give the performance that you're paying for and just focus on actually making said higher end gpus better first like literally a good 1660ti laptop with the right settings could match a 2070 max q without burning a hole through your laptop but regular joe's will see rtx 2070 think it must be better letters and buy that spending hundreds more for virtually no performance ,0,Mar-20
0, this would be a waste of money to purchase right now cause there are better ones coming out this isnt a console in a few every years there will be a better one unlike consoles they stay stuck with the same power graphics forever until they release the next gen im not buying a new one until i see games cant run on my pc anymore their slow ,1,Sep-20

0, i don't get why all the hype is on raytracing dlss is far better than ray tracing in terms of what you gain in aa games where the lighting is already very good without it dlss is amazing and that should be what nvidia is pushing the most ,1,Dec-20
0, the problem with the radeon vii is that the 5700 xt is just too close to it in terms of performance especially once you start really opening it up and tweaking the darn thing there are reports today of people managing to get to rtx 2080 level performance on stock 5700xt's which means pre overclocked cards are going to be able to get about that high right out of the box once aib's get to them with performance like that for so much less it's almost impossible to justify keeping the radeon vii on the market except as a productivity card okay granted pre overclocked partner cards are going to come at a slight premium especially if they're water cooled it probably won't be enough to suddenly make the rvii a viable alternative though ,1,Jul-19
0, maybe i'd be excited more about the rtx 2080 if only i could afford a gtx 1070 in the first place ,0,Aug-18

0, up to 20 pcie 4 lanes thats it what does that include thunderbolt so one thunderbolt port uses four lanes so thats two thunderbolt ports and a single graphics card and there goes your pcie lanes that doesnt sound right ,0,Oct-20
0, fun fact did you know ray tracing according to wikipedia is best suited for applications where the image can be rendered slowly ahead of time such as in still images and film and televisionvisual effects and more poorly suited for real time applications likevideo gameswhere speed is critical this likely will mean loots of slowdown if you try to use that feature b but battlefield v demo that could easily have been pre rendered and i wouldn't put it past ea to do that also no games support ray tracing right now so it's probably not a good idea to buy the graphics card as soon as it comes out ,0,Aug-18

0, modular graphics cards when like a card that has ram slots you buy a card it has no memory of its own and supports whatever the current fastest ram standard is then you could 1 have as much graphics memory as you wanted and 2 upgrade your card without buying an entirely new card ,0,Oct-20
0, why don't companies just stick to reasonable sensible naming schemes they fuck up their own already known naming so much it's annoying why is nvidia launching 3060 ti before 3060 not to mention the incoming supers and amd 600 series 6900 xt 6800 xt and 6800 why not just 6700 xt ,0,Nov-20

0, it's such a fantastic thing to happen in the linux world amd has a pretty solid reputation for almost anything relating drivers and nvidia was far behind in terms of compatibility and from what i've read in forums at least imo nvidia now only needs to support wayland instead of xwayland and they'll really force amd to improve themselves specially in other things than graphical computing such as a new good video streaming codec create new cli gui tools for the user i e an amd nvidia smi equivalent etc this and valve announcing that they're working on solid solutions about anti cheat are some of the best things relating to linux gaming that ever happened ,1,Jul-21
0, bought a radeon vii today will be using it for content creation rendering and engineering software should i return it and get 2080 super instead ,0,Jul-19
0, personal identification limit 1 per customer who are we kidding though nvidia does not give a toss they got their money they don't care what happens after that their apology is kinda like j allen brack's non apology means absolutely squat ,0,Sep-20

0, nvidia will launch super series that will have same memory or even less but not more becaause nvidia has already said fuck u gamers ,0,Aug-21
0, the 1650 sucks price wise it's great but you can't even play high settings on 1080p you need medium some high the rx 570 trumps it for 140 ish anyways now with the new drivers amd has delivered the rx 580 comes toe to toe with the 1070 you all can find these benches on your own everyone knows nvidia gimps their older cards to steer you towards the new line i think the rx 5500 might be more towards 1660 and even close to the ti variant new cards from amd are always miserable at launch but drivers always quickly fix the issues crossing fingers for under 200 xd ,0,Oct-19
0, if you have seen jay's video you'll know that it is incredible for the rtx 2080ti to get 30fps with ray tracing on as jay said in his video movie scenes have taken hours to render one frame with ray tracing so for the 2080ti to render frames in milliseconds is incredible ,0,Aug-18
0, i'm here in the philippines and we have a place called gilmore where there're a bunch of computer stores anyway we bought a laptop for our kid about 2weeks ago and all of the shop we went to had at least 1 3 or more 3070 and 3080 on display and some even had 3090 the only reason i can think of why we have availability here are either there are not enough rich people here or that people here don't want to buy scalper priced gpus from official retailers ,0,Nov-20
0, my 7870 finally died yesterday after a year of bsods and now i am on my old 4830 in windows 10 so i have no video acceleration for anything so these damn cards better hurry up and be priced like they were 2 years ago ,6,Jun-18
0, but can you use the a600 then for gaming sinds is has the same gpu as the rtx 3090 and 3080 and is it batter bcs of the vram ,0,Oct-20
0, even 30fps on the rtx cards is really good becuase normally ray traced scenes can't be done in real time movies done with ray tracing take hours or days per frame yes this is most likely because of the higher resolution and sfx gfx but still a ray traced frame being rendered in 1 30 of a second is really impressive you also have to keep in mind it was with an unfinished card with unfinished drivers with an unfinished game also wth verizon ,0,Aug-18
0, a thing james don't you mean a stack of 3090s that lmg is hoarding you guys are the real cause of the gpu shortage ,0,Jan-21

0, in fact it's hard to find an influencer that got cards so they can pitch us the hashrate and power consumption underclocked and undervolted ,0,Nov-20
0, nvidia should make the gpu has a system tht when the gpu is use for mining it'll locked down the gpu permenantly and to unlocked it back the miner must pay a fined maybe in 100 usd 300 usd so it'll make a loss to the miner ,0,Sep-21

0, i honestly believe the low end gpu market eg 3050 if it existed could be replaced by a proper next gen apu by amd in a year or so then you only really need a graphics card for 3060 level performance and up ,4,May-21
0, tbh with the new navi gpus are better specially after overclocking them like the navi 5700xt can be a radeon vii only with an overclock ,0,Jul-19

0, would be interested to see you review the 3060 on ltt when it's released and check if this hashrate limit has an impact on other types of workloads video editing machine learning etc sure geforce is for gamers but gamers also use their video cards for other things i'm running some machine learning workloads and have been looking at the 3060 12gb because i'm running into memory limits with the 8gb on my 2060 super i think the hashrate limit is probably a good move from nvidia but it would be a shame if the performance became artificially limited in all non gaming workloads ,0,Feb-21
0, 5700 runs hot shocker the last amd card i had was an asus strix r9 390 and even with the 3 fans it stayed between 88 92c in games and it was in a haf x case getting direct airflow lol unsurprisingly that card barely lasted a year ,0,Oct-19

0, if deep learning super sampling is so beneficial for the rtx series why dont they have the same thing for all other graphics cards imagine boosting ur frame rate by 20 by using that when you have an older gpu just release dlss for all gpus and then everyone is happy ,0,Aug-18
0, look at the nvidia rtx a600 immersive vr power the most immersive augmented reality ar and virtual reality vr experiences on the highest resolution head mounted displays hmds with accelerated graphics and increased display bandwidth four way explicit vr sli enables peak performance assigning two nvlink connected gpus to each eye we need to see this ,0,Oct-20
0, so since the cards would be cheaper to make they poured the remaining money to make an expensive reference cooling solution god damn it ,0,Jun-20
0, nvidia could have done this before i made my set up still this only looks like it addresses the part inside of the vm where nvidia intentionally disables the gpu if it detects it is running in a virtual machine rather than doing anything outside of the vm so to me a dual amd nvidia gpu set up still seems preferable from what i see disable any nvidia or nouveau drivers and use vfio ,0,Mar-21
0, nvidia is trying to cut in on the hype for amd amd could delay 2 more days for lols 2 weeks is not enough to make enough cards that's for sure ,0,Sep-20

0, btw jayztwocents confirmed on twitter that the problem is the same for the rx 6900xt they explode amd users beware it looks like it's been only touching beefy cards ,0,Jul-21
0, regarding the nvidia thing just don't update the driver for the 3060 unless they baked it into 300 series drivers from the beginning so you cannot just use an older driver even if that is the case i'm quite sure people will find a way they always do ,0,Feb-21
0, the way this whole cloud gaming thing is shaping up and the way devs are talking were soon going to have to buy a new license for games we own every time we upgrade a single piece of hardware in our pcs got a new ssd guess youre gonna need to license your entire game library all over again new stick of ram or upgraded to a better gpu we need moar money added gigabit ethernet hand us your wallet and this is why subscription services are going to become more and more common among publishers oh you dont want to keep licensing our games because you got new hardware we can take care of that for you for a monthly fee this is getting fucking ridiculous ,0,Mar-20

0, so you think xsx preorder will be better because by letting people know the time i think the scalper pro will be ready will their bot and clean up it much quickly than normal people they will clean it up at 8 o'clock on the dot just like nvidia series 30 card that what i think so ps5 random preorder actually better for normal customer i think xbox pre order will be chaos too i hope i'm wrong but i think we should be get ready pre enter the credit card and delivery address and other details to smooth our pre order and make it fast ,0,Sep-20

0, froze at the best time but i think what nvidia did was perfect and frankly should have happened years ago if they knew how i welcome this ,0,Feb-21
0, software will be sent out actually the software will limit the cards to not reach the targeted numbers so that the capacitors do not reach the frequency they're advertised for several of the suppliers are using 6 cheap capacitors that don't filter out the frequency noise appropriately whereas nvidia's suggested founder's card is using 4 of the expensive capacitors and two of the cheap ones suppliers were taking the cheap route and using all 6 of the cheap capacitors the high advertised frequencies then would drown each other out and cause crashes this is a hardware error made by suppliers trying to save money the inevitable and easy way out is to send out a patch so the cards cannot reach the high frequencies that would cause the cheap capacitors to crash i do not see them taking mass refunds or exchanges of cards all i can say is i'm glad people just haad to buy these out day one clean out the stock of poorly made cards and maybe the suppliers will remake the cards correctly this time ,0,Sep-20
0, i don't get why people don't like the design of rtx 3080 looks pretty cool and fresh and it's still the most important that it probably works well ,0,Jun-20

0, don't these people just know they can buy high capacity flash drives and sd cards format them as ntfs and use them as a hard drive it would be so much cheaper ,0,Apr-21
0, the gt 1030 is an okay card for around 80 usd and a 30w tdp it's largest issue is that it lacks h 265 decoding and h 264 h 265 encoding which is odd for a primarily multimedia card what i want to see from nvidia is a 16 20 series 'turing' architecture multimedia card for example base boost clock 1300 1400 1500 1600mhz about the same spec as a gt 1030 vram 2gb gddr5 cost savings from not using gddr6 can be allocated to h 264 h 265 decoding encoding av output hdmi x2 dvi d is less common these days and displayport is unrealistic given the spec tdp 60w right between a gt 1030 30w and a gtx 1650 80w ,0,Jan-21

0, mining but not buying that new gpu nvidia or amd they are totally worthless at resell can't game and old architecture ,0,Mar-21
0, if they knew they had issues with the card why not hold back and update the capacitors and give a reason if say evga went we are delaying releasing the rtx3080 as we've discovered some stability issues when the card goes above 2ghz we are working to resolve this that would've earnt them brownie points with the community due to them being honest and it would show they're putting the customer first and when other partners had the issues they would've went to evga afterwards ,0,Sep-20
0, yaay can't wait to pay double the money for a gpu and not make back the money when the gpu is idle while actual miners who got it for msrp still making 10 times the gpu's price ,0,Apr-21
0, all this price focus the gtx cards are more expensive than the rtx cards the rtx 2080 is cheaper than a 1080ti and has a slight performance boost over it i'd be stupid to buy a 1080ti ,0,Oct-18

0, i'm mostly interested on the pricing of the 300 series gpus if they're pricing them the same as the 200 series it'll be a huge skip for me ,0,Aug-20
0, i went and watched the hardware unboxed review a channel i've never watch before and if nvidia only looked at that video then they have a point it was 35 minutes and only 1 minute of it talked about ray tracing but they did a 20 minute video dedicated to ray tracing not longer after the initial review nvidia can do whatever they want but it does seem petty to stop sending review models to a channel you have history providing for over a feature that still hasn't been widely adapted i'd love to be able to get a 3080 at msrp and have every game support ray tracing and dlss but that isn't the world right now nvidia ,0,Dec-20
0, 3060 12 gib is the 1660 miners card of today but i don't advise buying one for 4 mining when recovering ur 300 purchase over 1 year because that's the nvda pitch its all systematic marketing conditional subliminal but maybe nvda is correct but may not be correct if u really are a participant in the massive gpu mining boom u r lot so just forget it mb ,0,Jan-21

0, sonic either's still looks 100 better than this nice try microfail and his doesn't require a rtx card all it requires is a 1070 or above so sues laughs at this even standard non ray traced shaders look better ,0,Aug-19
0, there is a software fix for the 3080 it's vbios that will limit the oc of the card didn't say it would be a good fix but hopefully they do more then that to fix these ,0,Sep-20

0, i'm glad that nvidia doesn't get arm without a fight they can't just acquire a very important company in just a whim ,0,Apr-21
0, best buy completely botched their launch not listing the card in stock until an hour and a half after they were supposed to of course i had to be at work by then so i missed out and guess i have to wait till next year best buy is supposed to be the major retailer of nvidias launches now by the way ,0,Nov-20
0, i really pick the worst times for a new gpu got a 970 right before the release of 10 series and i got a 1070ti 2 days ago ,0,Aug-18
0, no amount of catering to the mining community will increase the availability of other gpus so long as mining is done with calculations that can be done on a gpu they'll buy all of the mining carsd you can make and they'll also buy all of the gpus it's basic math i can make 100 day if i buy out all the mining gpus or i can make 1500 day if i buy out all the mining gpus and the regular gpus why would i not do that i mean i wouldn't personally because i am poor and can't afford to buy any gpus but the point stands miners are too incentivised to buy every gpu they can get their hands on putting out more chips will not change that also gonna be great when consoles are just htpcs like they were always intended to be ,0,Mar-21
0, this is away to make more under age gamer to buy rtx 2060 which have zero or very low value on raytracing good job i guess cant wait to see it in action ,0,Aug-19

0, don't deceive people by saying the xss will run games at 1440p 120fps games that manage that will be few and far between if any the hardware simply isn't good enough for next gen games to be hitting this benchmark without some serious graphical downgrading ,2,Sep-20
0, if they manage to deliver a decent card at a good price they are going to do tons of money due to the current lack of gpus ,0,Apr-21
0, 1440p 120fps with xbox series s sounds like bullshit 1440p 120fps is roughly 90 of 4k 60fps which is pretty unbelievable for a gpu with 4 tflops i want to see this result with a single aa game just one and i am convinced ,1,Sep-20
0, this is great for people who can actually afford 100 and 600 gpus but still no budget cards for us poor gamers ,1,Oct-20

0, capital one sponsored that awful verge pc build video there known on there bad credit card offers and now this hell naw dawg ,0,Jul-19
0, hold up so if i'm understanding this the 3060 saga has gone like this for nvidia nvidia reserves a likely significant portion of their very limited available silicon exclusively for miners nvidia uses this silicon to make mining cards with no display outputs making it difficult nigh impossible for gamers to use the cards nvidia announces that the remaining gaming cards will have a multipart lock that reduces their usefulness to miners by 50 miners now have dedicated silicon and reduced utility on other hardware gamers now have dedicated silicon that miners can still use and a portion of silicon locked off to them at a hardware level nvidia doesn't actually put a proper lock on the gaming cards cards can still be used to mine with no penalty miners now have full utility on all nvidia cards plus a dedicated inventory allocation during a silicon shortage gamers now lose access to that inventory and gain absolutely nothing in return that is such a massive backfire on nvidia's part that i can only assume it was intentional ,0,Feb-21
0, whats with the title all people bitch about is mid ranged card availability its literally what everyone wants or at least complains about wanting ,0,Sep-21

0, guys im worried about the global silicone shortage and that they will run out before i can get a card ,0,Mar-21
0, absolutely brilliant move nvidia not only gamers won't be able to pay for their new gpu by mining while not playing at current prices about 2 3 months but also they won't get a flood of cheap gpus when those became unprofitable plus those pro mining cards have awful efficiency but could have been full gaming cards otherwise is this what being on the gamer's side means ,0,Feb-21
0, i'm willing to bet lmg already has the dang cards and know everything about them they're just under embargo and the best they can do is rumors have been flying ,48,Aug-20

0, amd never show rt on test lol it's predicted this would happen with an rtx on and amd is the same shit like an nvidia for the stock amd not winning yet ,0,Nov-20
0, i play 4k games and the 2080ti with 12gb is enough for that plus you can always dedicate more video ram with your system ram slower for use with the gpu ,0,Sep-21
0, the problem will always be internet connection having a system that is always connected to the internet no matter what the system is for sure for a machine that surfs the net this is needed but you can have build other systems that stay away from the internet music production systems gaming systems as long as u don t care about multiplayer anymore i guess graphic design systems etc you can get the software you want from a net connected surfing machine and then transfer them on a gaming machine so long as you download things like net framework c updates and then transfer once in a while then you will still be good to go and so no os constant updates needed on windows 7 anyway in a world where just about everybodys machine is always hooked up to the internet there will always be problems followed by dodgy os patches and patches for software that needs patching because of other patches elsewhere a neverending cycle of insanity ,0,May-19

0, nvidia launches 3080ti everyone how can you be so selfish you could make like 2 3080s with each 3080ti wafer nvidia launches improved 2060 which could provide many gamers the performance they want can afford and improve gpu stock everyone this is outrageous make 3080tis and 4080s already instead ,0,Sep-21

0, arm should not be brought by nvidia its used in far to many 3rd party units not to mention the thousands of patterns that use by other companies there is no way nvidia will honour the rules beyond x amount of regulators years not to mention any 3rd party will have there fees jacked up over time ,0,Apr-21
0, they can just buy nvidia products if they want to review them i dont get why people are mad the only reason any company sends out review samples is to help market their product they dont owe you anything lol also hardware unboxed is the most obvious shill channel ever you dont ever have to watch their videos because they say buy amd ,0,Dec-20

0, wtf is wrong with game devs nvidia is not charging for geforce now so the game devs are not losing any money on the contrary they could gain more money because there are some ppl who only buy their games because they can only play it on geforce now should game developers remove their games from all nvdia graphics cards because nvidia doesn't pay or inform them that ppl can play on them wtf why it should matter that i play on my computer or a remote one you can use steam on geforce now why should nvidia pay or notify anybody else than steam ,0,Mar-20

0, hey yall im going to rant about the rtx 3060ti on bestbuy so this morning i got up at 5am where i live and went to the best buy website at around 7ish when they started selling cards you had to click a button that randomly changed every once in a while if you somehow managed to do that it would take you to a new page where you have to put in a verification code sent to your email after that you go to your checkout screen where you have to select a store to pick up this card that you ordered online and of course the only three stores within 250miles of me was out of stock in about 1 second on top of that before you even get to the random changing button it says and i quote get the rtx3060ti shipped to the town name redacted by thursday so that was bestbuys drop of the 3060ti ,0,Nov-20

0, unless overclocking and the silicon lottery come into play when it comes to mining my thought is that these companies should make it so the mining variants of these cards should out perform the gaming versions of the cards who knows maybe video passthrough will make the mining cards better gaming gpus and the miners will know how it feels to have their resources taken from them if we can finally turn the tables ,0,Mar-21

0, you know what fuck it i'm not buying a gpu i'll just wait two years until the prices drop a little bit this is getting fucking out of hand ,0,Nov-20
0, graphics card makers should put in crypto currency blocks on consumer cards then allow it on commercial use card like nvidia quadro and amd's commercial use models those fetch a much higher price normally such cards are not optimized for game use but have graphics features consumer cards have blocked so that engineering companies can run cad applications smoothly if the scalpers want crypto cards then they will have to pay 200 to the card makers ,0,Dec-20
0, nvidia is already a big leader in the ai space they have a monopoly over chips for training ai models ,0,Sep-20
0, i may be wrong but i feel like people wanted cheaper freesync monitors that they can use with the exspensive nvidia cards they blew their money on not exspensive gsync monitors too use with amd's more budget oriented stuff yes i know the radeon 7 and 5700xt are quite capable ,0,Nov-19
0, save your time people nvidia's announcement robot car a i more a i trace the rays and maybee new quadro done ,0,Apr-20
0, actually it's the prettiest design from nvidia since ever i mean what can go uglier than the rtx 2xx series ,0,Jun-20

0, love you anthonyy i hope that dosent make me gay but with respect all of use knows that you are getting paid by nvidia ,0,Jul-19
0, should start stocking up on hdd drives learned my lesson with gpu's to this day i'm still 3 generations behind but in my defence i dint want to get gpu's because generation performance improvement was laughable only the fantasy 300 series looked worthy ,0,Apr-21
0, there's literally already an rtx esque shaders pack if not mutliple that utilise it that and those shaders are probably only coming to either windows 10 edition or bedrock in general and not java ,0,Aug-19
0, the whole gpu situation as it is must be pushing more pc gamers over to consoles i am still pushing my rx480 to the max ,0,May-21
0, you gotta love the support for corporations over people here yes let's not hold amd or nvidia to the fire for underproducing stock and for retailers not placing limits on the amount of product someone can buy no let's go after the people trying to improve their financial situation and trying to break the vicious cycle of wage slavery and poverty a winning battle for sure ,0,Apr-21
0, is ray tracing going to be an nvidia only thing is this going to by like physx which revolutionized graphics years ago they were running out of raw horsepower improvements so they decide to reinvent the standard of measurement no benchmarks yet so at this point so dont hold your breath ,0,Aug-18
0, cool amd need put nvidia in there place lol though im happy with my gtx 1080ti for now who say in 2 3 yrs though url could this be true could rtx just be refreshed version with a few changes from the titan v ,1,Sep-18
0, i just got my gtx1080ti in feb of this year but i want to upgrade to the 2080ti once it finally drops will i be able to remove my old card and drop in the new one using the same connectors and everything or do i need to change more than just the card itself ,0,Aug-18
0, honestly the xbox series x sounds insane we better get some good reasonably priced gpus soon because clearly and and nvidia are easily capable of delivering them ,0,Feb-20
0, so they cancel the super duper graphics pack because they feel that not enough people have pc's that are good enough only to announce this how is nobody calling them out on this ,0,Aug-19
0, amd will bite the hand that feeds good luck trying to sell their subpar gpus if they replicate nvdias move let me add something hey influencers stop getting the gpus miners are not buying ,0,Mar-21
0, that probably explains the rise in btc price rtx3090 ray tracing and dlss can help mine more coins esp the 24gb vram one ,0,Nov-20
0, by inventing cryptocurrency we basically invented a way to create money by wasting electricity this already f ed up graphics cards market now it's moving towards f ing up hdd and ssd market looking at the trend it will at some point f up the electronics chip market by adding to chip shortages those asic have to come from somewhere and have potential to f up the electric energy markets in many countries and by that virtue also potential to f up alternative energy sources markets in said countries so lets burn more energy and f up our economy more to earn more virtual money to afford stuff that got more expensive because we burned so many energy and f ed up economy seems like good idea to me ,0,Apr-21
0, that mock up in the thumbnail is the sexiest thing ive ever seen and the graphics card looks pretty good too ,0,Aug-21
0, i'm all for gimping gaming cards' ability to mine maybe i'll actually be able to find one in stock for less than both arms and legs edit yea they'd figure out a way past it anyway so disadvantagese might be bigger than advantages hm ,0,Feb-21
0, not a big deal for nvidia they already made their money on 10 series gpus r d and profit goals already hit dumping 300 00 gpu chips that cost less than 10 each to manufacture is peanuts for a company worth 152 billion ,0,Jun-18
0, tried dxr and dlss on bfv earlier you can't tell a difference between taa and dlss unless you squint at your screen from two inches away most people wouldn't notice game still looks like there's a thin layer of oil on the screen whether you use dlss or taa i won't be using it with bfv for obvious reasons performance over visuals in competitive fps' but i'm sure as hell turning rtx on with metro exodus and playing it on my 55 4k tv ,0,Feb-19
0, tbh common miners are not to blame its the bigger miners i am a gpu miner but even i don't go out and buy 50 gpus in one sitting most i get is 1 or 2 per month or so i don't want to kill the market for gpus and any smart person would think the same but people who can buy 50 gpus don't care so stop putting us all on the bad side it pisses me off ,0,Mar-21
0, ur a shill all i hear is excuses for nvidia probably because they send you more gpus than u can use ,0,Nov-20
0, i honestly don't really care about getting a new console at this point they still lack content a gpu would be nice though ,6,May-21
0, if you think cyperpunk is buggy then you haven't play enough game yet lol not saying it's acceptable but lots big games on some pc couldn't even start just errors or it boots up and crash etc cyberpunk seems mostly graphical errors and bugs that can be fix by reloading save still annoying but runable ,0,Dec-20

0, what's the point of selling a mid ranged gpu for that much it's just going to be inflated anyway now it will be double inflated ,13,Sep-21
0, nvidia swept up all the pascal dust from the floor and glued it together to make the only gpu you can buy right now ,0,Jan-21
0, im pissed i cant get a 3080 still ive been waiting literally 3 years to build myself a new computer because i didnt feel the cards were a good value i now do and plan on getting a 3080 but if i have to wait month why not just wait for the revision so annoying ,2,Oct-20
0, wait the thumbnail was a quadro is this gonna be a new work card or is it a consumer gaming card ,0,Apr-20
0, i think nvidia might have gotten away with it if they just didn't talk about the crippling and instead just talked up the efficiency advantage of the cmp not having to cater to gaming tasks ,0,Feb-21
0, and since zotac also leaked the sku for a 3090ti i'm pretty sure in a few more months we will see that too thanks nvidia ,32,Aug-21
0, the 3070 didn't sell out in hours it sold out in 5 minutes in the us and best buy who sold most of the f e had a glitch in their system to where most of the united states couldn't get a card shipped to them even if it was in their cart and their information was already filled out ,0,Oct-20
0, well miners take all the gpus good guy nvidia increases the price to combat that gamers buy the gpus nvidia makes more money yayee ,0,Nov-20
0, that freesync hack would probably work with dummy hdmi plugs i think you would only need to force the amd gpu into thinking it's connected to a monitor for it to be enabled ,0,Aug-18
0, my theory nvidia was planning to launch 12gb cards then crypto bubble started nvidia knew crypto mining doesn't need more than 8gb vram launching super or ti version with bigger vram would be a waste as they are directly shipping to the miners watch out for nvidia's revenue disclosure we may find how much they made from miners ,0,Sep-21
0, amd for the most part had no performance loss from hdr while nvidia consistently lost performance it's not a huge difference but if you are going for 4k hdr experience and can't afford a 1080ti or better amd is the better choice ,0,Jul-18
0, i have a gainward gtx970 and for a 1 fan blower style cooler its a very good card and ive had it for 6 years now ,0,Aug-20
0, ltt the only channel to think gpus are for gaming what cunts since pandemic people that need workstations are working from home and want a workstation that can game anyone that isn't a canadian closet reject with a mail order wife will tell you that more vram is better as that is where meshes are stored and if say blender for example runs out it starts to use slower system memory fuckingg rejects ,0,Sep-21
0, avathar behemoth how can you be about something that doesn't even exist for all we know it could be just like rtx or worse ,0,May-19
0, damn 1500 dollars i put down 35 dollars for two years out of gift cards i got for christmas got hope for the game but not to pay actual money for that lol also really glad to see madison on board d ,0,Feb-21
0, if the 6700xt is gonna have 6gb it better be priced accordingly hope they don't try upsell us on a lower tier card just cause it's slightly faster they are gonna shoot themselves on the foot just like nvidia did with the original 2060 if that's the case ,0,Sep-20
0, was looking at a rtx 3070 i read and it said that they would send a temporary card to use for until the 3070 comes in stock the temporary card was a gtx 1030 or whatever aight imma head out ,0,Jan-21
0, had the perfect opportunity to say rage racing as well but i digress trampling people over a finite supply of graphics cards is not good ,0,May-21
0, can ya make a uml graph or something to explain the nvidia naming scheme i want visual representation of confusion ,0,Jul-20
0, i don't understand why they are making nvidia remove titles from the service when they are games that we already own in the first place just a bunch of haters in my enzo amore voice ,0,Feb-20
0, nvidia is delaying 3070 because they screwed up the 3080 launch so bad and they know 3070 is an even bigger market they've likely put their card making robots in overdrive to try to crank as many out as possible before then ,0,Sep-20
0, nvidia no one is subscribing to our streaming service oh we know what to do just make the subscription double the price that'll teach them ,0,Mar-21
0, imagine if the new ampere gpus are just like the 400 500 series from 10 years ago really hot and power hungry ,0,Apr-20
0, evidence of gpu price fixing restricting supply to increase profit pretty much exactly what the ram cartels are being fined for id say its the scam of the century but the forces behind the banks have got them beat by a loong way predatory capitalism continues to help exponentially increase the wealth divide time this amoral behaviour was brought to task ,0,Jun-18
0, seeing as only 2 3080 models have a restock date at the vendor atm i don't think 3070 is going to look much better said restock date is 26th of november btw all the rest are unknown it looks like all amd will have to do this year is actually let me buy a card ,0,Sep-20
0, if the scalpers didn't get you then the import fees will so in the end the great pricing for these cards won't matter by the time we can actually buy the stupid things ,0,Jan-21
0, i am going to leave roughly the same comment here as i left on hardware unboxed twitter post over 99 of games out there do not and will not ever support ray tracing it would be doing the gaming community a huge disservice to ignore the traditional rasterisation performance of modern graphics cards ,0,Dec-20
0, there arent much choices if you want 4k 60 for your older office setup i bought a nice new shiny screen for my dad and had to find out his gt 710 could only display 4k 30 so a cheap and power efficient video card was needed got a used 1030 for him a 50 bucks 1010 delivered next day would have been an instant buy for me that day without the hassle of used stuff ,0,Jan-21

0, im looking to upgrade my rx480 4gb to a rtx 2060 super should i wait for the 300 card to come out ,0,May-20
0, they should just call the new gpu the gtx 1560 1570 1580 because it's halfway between the 10 20 series cards ,0,Jan-19
0, i'd hard encode antimining on gaming cards like how it throttles furmark kombustor and release mining cards the amount of rx500 and older gpus ive had to restore from abusive mining is ridiculous ,0,Mar-21
0, to but the end user shouldn't have to do this it should just easily happen in a reasonable variety of gui graphical settings adjustment options in game come on devs ,0,Dec-20

0, it is easy to get freesync to work on nvidia for those who don't play around in the settings switch freesync on in your monitor settings then go to nvidia control panel re select your resolution pc resolution not ultra hd hd sd then select your correct hz and use display port cable it work for me give it try ,0,Aug-18

0, wait so no new drivers for nvidia 700 cards from that date lol there are real big and popular pc hw stores here in poland that sell new 710 or 720 cards it was sad even when you had an option to update but now it's just something more ,0,Jun-21
0, way too early to talk amd 570 boards are requiring active cooling on the chip set while navi was not presented as a graphics card but a gpu chip in hand okay okay they showed a demo of a game that can run on a toaster probably using vulcan no navi graphics card in hand was it a navi gpu in the rig no shots of the rig and no msi afterburner come back with proof and price ,0,May-19
0, gigabyte is a shitty company most of their product gets bricked a year ago my friend bought a rx 5700xt from gigabyte it was keep crashing then he replaced it with sapphire rx5700 xt within 4 days that gpu is still running like a beast ,0,Aug-21
0, i could see many turning rtx off on minecraft because they don't want the darkness that the shadows make in the first place ,0,Aug-19
0, nvidia should punish publishers that pull out from geforce now by barring their games from using ray tracing it's a silly idea but that'll make those pesky publishers think twice p ,0,Feb-20

0, rtx 30 series laptops in january my 1660ti laptop is suddenly feeling old eh it still gets 120fps in everything i want to play i'll probably have it until the 40 series ,0,Nov-20
0, if amd was smart they wouldn't do anything but make sure their graphics cards are as good as possible at mining let nvidia make the mistake of trying to fuck gamers over amd could capitalize by not doing the same if you can make 5 20 a day mining with your graphics card while not gaming why wouldn't you i do my 3090 is half paid for now ,0,Mar-21
0, nvidia tipping the fact that they actually don't have a shortage i mean if there was a shortage it sure would make it hard to explain why microcenter has stacks of amd cards across the entire product stack they can't shift at their gouged prices ,2,Sep-21
0, at mark everybody his wasting their time shaming amd's new graphics card for not having ray tracing lol wow only two games have that feature this year amd did a smart move of not adding it to their radeon 7 graphic card ,0,Feb-19
0, cards like the 1010 are very handy when you've got a server with no igpu and need basic display output the problem is that it has no vga output not even on the dvi port and vga is a lot more common with servers than desktops it's exactly the kind of card where you want maximum flexibility especially since many kvms are still vga ,0,Jan-21
0, greedy ass miners just want the resale value of the card not to take a hit they want to take all the gfx cards from gamers and use the shite out of them and when new gpu's come out they sell the old 24 7 in use ones that they have 30 of to gamers making money on the frontside and backside ,0,Feb-21
0, if nvidia released a 16xx version of the 2080 basically a 1080 ti at a lower price would amd have to lower the price of the radeon vii could they ,0,Feb-19
0, there is already a radeon 5700 line of gpus too just 10 years ago why not 900 series where they left off ,0,May-19

0, wow i am suprized in this 6 minutes no good information that i wanted to know and even i saw it on kik obzor channel video about it i thinked there will be more information here or same but no here is so minimum information i am suprised how bad video is and there is no details why rtx 2080 will be 6 times better then gtx 1080 ,0,Aug-18
0, bro literally every gpu right now is worth more used right now than it was new at launch my 1060 goes for 250 350 on ebay right now ,0,Jan-21
0, yeah epic where i live the best laptop you can get has a i7 8700 and a gtx 1080 ti so maby we will get rtx 2080 now ,0,Jan-21
0, nvidia is doing this for one reason and that is to please the share holders because this makes it that the used market will not be saturated with graphics cards when the crypto bubble bursts and nvidia can keep selling more ,1,Feb-21
0, should your buddy be allowed to pre install halo on millions of xboxs just because some other people have personal licenses for them nvidia is offering direct access to the games as big part of the services appeal i think it is pretty justified for game comps to want a share ,0,Mar-20
0, fck drm says cd projekt red so i guess that is also the message for making freesync work with a geforce graphics card and its heard loud and clear ,0,Aug-18
0, big middle finger to everyone that can't afford 1 4 1 2 their total build cost for a half decent gpu ,1,Jun-19
0, no benchmarks outside of showing it does raytracing better than previous cards gee call me curious as to why that is those comparison numbers were implicitly regarding its raytracing performance not overall general performance anyone who thinks a 2080 will be 4x faster than a titan v is smoking a lot of pot ,0,Aug-18
0, if only there was a way to make gpus all have shit hash rates for crypto but not be shit for gaming and other useful workloads thing is if this was done the miners would just edit their software to ident as blender or some other non game processing load so they would not get throttled ,0,Dec-20
0, i wonder if mr huang made those remarks because he's genuinely confident the rtx will crush radeon or if he's worried that performance numbers will be so overwhelmingly surprising that amd will outright win in price to performance dr lisa su is a class act i really admire her ,0,Jan-19
0, thats crazy how you can pay 100k for the graphics cards to mine and recoup from mining within the year and prolly sell the cards at a relatively small discount essentially doubling your money ,0,Dec-20
0, to be fair decent integrated graphics is a huge benefit for the consumer why the hell should my graphics card even draw power when i'm only watching videos or movies and am not actually playing or rendering or something ,0,Nov-20
0, the nvidia gt 1010 could probably run doom 3 far cry and half life 2 at max settings at 1600x1200 at 60 fps this thing would have been a monster in 2004 ,0,Jan-21

0, so i guess i don't understand even without a frame rate limiter your card can only push so hard so what's pushing the power limit and voltage limits of the cards ,0,Jul-21
0, idk how you people can turn this into a bad thing yes nvidia is going to make more money on them than they should but you guys make more than you should too so ,0,Sep-21
0, never say never when it comes to hacking i just hope they made getting and using the hacked gpu such a pain and not worth the effort like making a hacked gpu only usable for like 5 minutes before it dies forever ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia is a little bitch since hardware unboxed will have separate video focused on dlss ray tracing etc this is how hu approach every game ,0,Dec-20
0, why would you mine cryptocurrency with a gpu in 2020 you wont profit you practically have to mine with asics now ,0,Nov-20

0, current '4k' consoles upscale from 1440p i suspect what will happen is that the next gen console will actually render near or up to 4k and then upscale from there if you look at the upcoming navi graphics chips amd are due to release soon they look to be good 1440p cards for pc with the increased efficiency of console platforms largely due to having a very limited variation in hardware spec that could translate to them acting as a basic 4k gpu ,0,Jun-19
0, back then i didn't have enough money to buy a gaming pc now there is no gpu in the market neither money in my pocket ,0,Apr-21
0, yes the future is ray tracing but this cards 2070 2080 is not the future if anything its the fetus or even sperm sperm still processing if it can merge with ovum who bought this are dumb they are lab white mice used for testing until xx60 series support ray tracing 1080p 60fps 3a title that is the real future this is not ,0,Aug-18

0, again with this crypto currency bs i had a hard enough time getting my hands on a rx 580 back then cryptocurrency has come full circle with taking our gpus from pc gamers ,1,Dec-20

0, whos waiting on the bots to buy all the amd cards it worked out for the nvidia launch why not keep the gravy train rolling ,0,Nov-20
0, unfortunately bad reporting apparently customers have also reported crashes with the asus tuf and rog lines who both use only the expensive type of capacitors as well as crashes with the fe cards this means that the problem with the capacitors while one of the reasons is not the whole story and could be the result of either bad drivers or a more fundamental problem with the 30 series architecture ,0,Sep-20

0, life before death strength before weakness journey before destination but i feel like nvidia and amd have broken the oathpact ,0,Nov-20
0, i'm actually on the nvidia side here good move only wish they could cripple mining to a grinding halt if the miners need more computing power go for the proper mining hardware and stop leeching on the gamer market and nvidia start producing actual mining cards oh you already are well then ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia saying there are too many cards to sell is just flat out lying and extremely irritating they're still selling for over 700 when they could have been sold for 500 they could have sold every last one of them within a month kept the jaded gamers still reeling from mining and resellers marking their products up 300 in some cases but not nvidia though they'd rather destroy them than sell them i'll bet the new cards will be double msrp right off the bat even without mining demand ngreedia ,0,Aug-18

0, 3060ti rx6700xt i know the card doesn't exist but that seriously could be amd's answer to the lower end if nvidia makes the move and even lower end would certainly be useful since here at least that's still a 1030 or so ,0,Nov-20
0, i guess nvidia felt amd came a little too close in this last gen and all of a sudden we get these massive improvements xd i'm hoping amd s response is you fool this is not even my final form ,0,Jan-21
0, hmm that nvidia drawing thing might be useful for people who do fanart instead of finding royalty free backgrounds or spending forever making your own you can just bash something simple out in paint then run it through that for a unique background image ,0,Jun-21
0, wrong nvidia didn't imply that they want positive reviews they said that they want ray tracing reviews they can be negative too well if amd could keep up ah political speech where both sides are full of crap equally ,0,Dec-20
0, oof i just bought and installed an rtx 2080 from memory express much better than the gtx 970 i had though ,12,Jun-19
0, if they were to sell the gpu's at a discount it would have to fall somewhere around the same price per performance as the 11 series cards releasing if you could get a 1080 ti that is 20 less powerful for 300 cheaper than the 1180 nobody would buy the new cards so they can't make a super sale they could however continue to sell 10 series cards alongside the 11 series at a slightly better price to perf as 11 series until they use the inventory idk just my guess ,0,Jun-18

0, hey guys i just wanted to say that most of you are really fortunate in were i live i can't even think about getting a graphics card that is priced colesly to 2060 but in us or other developed countries people are buying graphics cards from scalpers because they don't want to wait until graphics cards are normally priced ,4,May-21

0, if reddit can do that to a company then they can fill that gap in the market for a 50 1050ti card a five year gap it seems that no one wants to fill hence fake cards filling the void its an ungoverned space crying our for some new leadership ,0,Jan-21
0, i'd say nvidia acquiring arm is a good thing arm practically has a monopoly these days if nvidia acquires them it means other companies are forced to invest to come up with some proper competition besides that the other major companies not wanting nvidia to take over are guilty of far worse pot calling the kettle black ,0,Feb-21
0, dont know much but graphics cards but if amd and nvida are using old chips to create cryto cards than i dont think its so bad because what else would they do with those chips dont think this will help gamers cuz miners will take anything they can get there hands on but if they are giving old or lower quality chips a second life then why not do it ,0,Mar-21
0, in 1st quarter 2018 if you told me that nvidia and g sync would totally dominate the sync market then i would laugh in your face but thats exactly what happened in 2019 in one year nvidia has totally changed the game and exploited amd incompetence to totally own the display refresh branding from now when you buy a monitor the only thing that matters is if g sync compatible or not ,0,Nov-19
0, rumors are looking good for amd's new 600 series gpus too bad none of us are going to get them cuz bots lol ,0,Nov-20

0, just throw 2 of the gpus on a board and call it a super titan or something stupid like that not like they have not done it before ,0,Jul-18
0, my guess is the reason for the the double fan design with one on each side of the heat sink is because they have some kind of new cooling system that cools from both the top and bottom funnily enough this is also what the cooling system for the ps5 is leaked to be like a double cooling system from the top and bottom my question is does this basically confirm that the rtx 300 series will literally cost 300 lol ,1,Jun-20
0, if you think about it for a moment those rtxon off comparisons look good in minecraft look good only because minecraft never had any good light system there were no shadows and light was calculated by blocks ,0,Aug-19

0, ive never had a pc but i'm hopefully getting an r5 3600 build once i get a job turning 16 in a month this is the build i want url already have 8gb ddr4 a friend gave me so that's why theres only 8gb on list originally was going for a 650 i5 9400f and gtx 1070 build but realized id rather save up and get better parts plus zen launch was too compelling any suggestions monitor isnt final i really want a 1440p 100 hz ips monitor but that's going to be like 500 600 and i could buy and high end gpu with that ,0,Jul-19
0, good one big green bullies with great graphics cards lol and yea no wonder i never got thank sneaky data sniffer ,0,Jul-19
0, i'm surprised nobody can just bodge freesync into working on nvidia just by taking advantage of how gsync laptops work which is just freesync ,15,Aug-18
0, all smoke and mirrors here nvidia have not made a card that's many times faster six times ten times nonsense the top end card is maybe twice as fast as a 1080 at running normal games there i said it the super duper speed leaps only come in when its ray tracing which is almost never so you're buying a load of extra hardware you will probably never use ,75,Aug-18
0, i just don't understand amd had to provide xbox and ps5's but completely fu ed off the pc gamers and yet nvidia doesn't have that market but still struggle with stock something's just not right with market atm perhaps shenanigans between companies ,0,Nov-20

0, the 3090 is a twin gpu card the cooler with the opposing fans that was leaked is a 3090 only cooler for that twin gpu card that is why youll notice there is no sli socket on the leaked 3080 cards because there will be no more sli with the 300 series as there is a twin gpu 3090 ,0,Jun-20

0, oh great so that's where the other half of gpus went not surprising tbh gg nvidia guess i'll have to wait with my rx 570 even longer now ,0,Nov-20
0, what is with all the msi hate in the comments someone at msi made a small mistake thus starlit partner a subsidiary of msi that handles dead stock refurbished open box items etc for them and sells it on ebay got their hands on some of the new cards and figured it would look good on their report if they sold them on ebay for a ridiculously high price when msi realised they stopped it apologized and offered compensation in the form of partial or full refunds to the customers who bought the cards on ebay it was definitely not an evil plot to milk the high demand stop fabricating conspiracy theories and watch the wan show instead ,0,Oct-20

0, one part of me hope nvidia do succeed with this gaming hardware to the gaming community the other part of me knows it'll be circumvented in no time flat how about fooling the drivers the payload to be crunched is a game how can it differeniate the two if they get similar enough well duh one produce graphics the other don't yeah well how about just showing some dummy graphics while crunching one that uses the crunched data i don't think nvidia wants to risk affecting games with a too tough filter that might shoot down games as well ,0,May-21
0, i've been wanting to build a pc with a gtx 1060 for a while now but now that the gtx or rtx 2060 is coming out with that sweet gddr6 memory i think i may get one ,3,Aug-18
0, so the navi is 330 usd or around 500 cad after mark ups and hype at launch a 2070 can be had for around 600 650 at best today that's not a huge gap given that the rtx has better game support and feature sets that are supported in game gameworks etc nothing is stopping team green from just dropping those prices by 100 bucks to close the gap not sure what's the big hoopla here i'm a current amd gpu user btw so yeah ,0,May-19

0, nvidia isn't stupid but they assume us gamers are they're basically a mining gpu maker right now 7 a day on the 3060 on other cryptocurrency a new mining only line yep they care about the gamers ,0,Feb-21
0, i loove real time ray tracing there just isn't any with touring rtx and right now it doesn't look like that is about to change anytime soon so i'll have those 16 gigs of hbm2 instead for the same price actually here about 60 100 less at least i can actually use that in muh workloads and my ultra textured modded games today i'm not gonna consider paying a premium for features that are all dressed up and half a year later still has nowhere to go regardless of what the damn thing is called its a tool not a christmas sweater you don't buy expensive tools based on empty promises of them one day becoming useful you either buy a different tool that you do need or you hold off your purchase until there is an actual use for it ,0,Feb-19

0, on the topic of 2060 re release because 300 series isn't available personaly i'm perfectly happy with a 3070 ti i bought recently reviewers and the internet mob might shit on the card but in the european market i was in it's actually the best and only viable choice and in terms of bad performance increase not worth it the card still slays through everything at 1440p ultra point is it's preferable to buy a 300 card even one that online reviewers who get it for free try to bury it as long as in your specific budget situation and market conditions it's a good deal then you should go for it better having a newer card than a re release older gen imo ,0,Sep-21

0, kwest used to be a legit if niche business dealing in personal protective gear and medical supplies i hesitated to order a card from them since it was an unusual product for them to carry now my bank is investigating the whole thing as fraud i bought one card from kwest out of desperation thinking i'd fried my 5600 xt i hadn't it just didn't like my old motherboard ,0,Aug-21
0, nvidia straight copying amd by finally giving people enough vram to make their gpu worth the price i say copying because they had years to catch up and they still kept throwing customers scraps of vram below minimum req on some games out of the box when a rx570 has more vram than a 3060 yeah about time funny that when nvidia does it suddenly they can explain why high vram is important while when amd does it fine wine is as far as they go ,0,Sep-21
0, nvidia is only preventing the normal consumers from using their cards for mining large scale mining companies with millions or billions hire ex nvidia engineers to rewrite the bios and unlock the limiters this only prevents us from being able to use our cards for mining when we arent gaming on them ,0,Feb-21

0, i was on the meh side on rt x i do see ray tracing etc is the future but back in 2018 i don't see it as great yet but now seeing how minecraft visual changed soo much with ray tracing i'm on the pro side on rtx i always though that ray tracing could only be done on 'in development' games as we see with bf5 and tomb raider back in 2018 but after seeing that rt could be implemented on older game such as minecraft means that ray tracing etc can be implemented to all games as long as the devs are willing which tickle my interest on what if those features be implemented on skyrim witcher 3 etc etc as i see that simpler less intensive graphics game for today's standards could be improved wayy more and i'll be on the first to get the next gen 'ray tracing' gpu ,0,Aug-19

0, like nvidia didn't learn from the gtx 1060 1080 idk why they just don't make mining cards on launch day now the entire industry has to suffer with part shortages because of the hope that the most powerful gpus wouldn't be enough to influence miners to upgrade ,1,Feb-21

0, i feel like the whole overclocking graphic cards is not what it used to be it seems that they are gimping cards on purpose to let people overclock them to feel happy about overclocking their cards rather then something people did to actualy max out preformance on something not set to the preformance you push it to from start rather then today where it seems to be a marketing point to push super preformance boost by overclocking overclocking this brings more preformance wowowow kinda seems to me like they indeed deliver cards underpowerd to satisfy people with overclocking themself ,0,Sep-18
0, 8k sure ok that only requires 16x or 1 600 more power than 1080p consoles struggle at 4k some games even today still run at 900p but they're going to sexdecuple graphical processing power this generation i want 60fps to be standardised on consoles then focus on resolution then graphical pretty settings pixellated slide shows completely negate fancy graphics anyway ,3,Apr-19

0, does it matter that jensen coached and schooled his niece to take over the competition as well must be some dinner when lisa and jensen sit down to discuss how to make nvidia untouchable while still 'appearing' to be a 2 team competition surely it has to be noticed that nvidia stock has skyrocketed from 5 billion to 350 billion since she went to amd it started exactly when she went there and suddenly amd changed a path it had been in to a useless one that cost it market share and cash to then bring out an 'equal' gpu that you just can't get while lying about costs scam ,0,Nov-20

0, 50 to 100 below retail and they will sell in less than a week come on nvidia pascal is 2 year old architecture they should not be priced as high as they are it's the equivalent of someone paying msrp for a 2 year old car that's been sitting on a car lot that no one bought they are simply just not worth as much as launch ,0,Jun-18
0, i thought rtx was an alternate line to gtx and they were still going to release new gtx cards as well ,0,Aug-18
0, glad i held off on the rtx i had the money for an rtx about 6 months after it was released which i knew meant i should just wait another 6 more to get a better card for the same price ,0,Jun-19

0, what gpu family supports the new hardware accelerated gpu scheduling i updated my drivers and am up to date on windows 10 and all i have in graphics settings is variable refresh rate which no one else seems to have looking at the screenshots and graphics performance preference i am on maxwell with a 980 ti i can't find any info on what hardware you need to have this option oh and great nvidia control panel is gone ,0,Jun-20

0, i just consider the gpu thing another nail in the coffin of the crypto currency demand go on ebay lots of good priced gtx 1060's and 1070's 1060 3gb's are about 190 1070's are about 310 only the highest end cards and for some reason the 1050 ti series cards are stupidly overpriced 1050 ti's at the minimum 170 so there is no reason to get that over a 1060 3gb 1050's are mostly well behaved on the used market 115 125 rx 560's are mostly where they are supposed to be at saw a 2gb for 100 bucks shipped rx 460's are 74 bucks this is the new budget king imo rx 570 470's are a little uncomfortable but not crazy high for prices 220 and rx 580's are at where they should be 250 for 8gb model vega cards are still overpriced vega 56 is 460 bucks and vega 64 is close to msrp with 520 being the lowest i saw for buy it now dont be worried about gpu pricings cards are available now with the used market having reasonable prices people dont have to get these overpriced new ones which forced the prices to drop heck i saw a 1080 ti for 625 on ebay ,0,Jun-18
0, that was a deliberate move by cyberpunk 2077 as a kickback for nvidia while nvidia wanted to promote this game as showing off their ray tracing abilities that supposedly put amd to shame it was a ploy between them this was deliberate ,1,Dec-20

0, how can you fuck up gpu launches so badly and still have such a fail this long after launch like how unprepared were they for this shit jesus you might as well not have fucking launched it ,0,Dec-20
0, honestly i don't understand why people are upset about scalping if people are willing to pay 100 for a ps5 then let them if people weren't willing to buy these consoles at that price it wouldn't be an issue i'm willing to bet that if one of these people complaining about scalpers actually managed to buy a console or graphics card for 500 and they learned that people were paying 100 for them they would probably sell it the smart thing to do for anyone who managed to buy one of these consoles or graphics cards before they were out of stock would be to sell it for profit and then buy another one once they were more widely available at the end of the day it's an issue with companies not having enough stock and an issue with people not understanding supply and demand a small supply with a large demand leads to the price going up regardless of if the seller is a 'bot' or a 'scalper' or just some lucky guy looking to make a quick buck anyone who is complaining is just salty they can't sell their console graphics card for double the price or too impatient to wait an extra month or two for a product that's taken years to develop ,1,Nov-20

0, i started hating air coolers on gpus when i got a big boy vega 64 even though it had an already very good cooler because it was a sapphire nitro and i undervolted it all medium to large powered gpus should be water cooled i hate to get called by the air force to tell me my pc is flying over some restricted areas because its gpu's fans has gone nuts ,0,Aug-21

0, can someone please tell me why everyone is so pissed at nvidia the whole point to a company giving out freebies is for them to show it off and prove what nvidia says at announcement when a reviewer isn't giving people the details of new features of new hardware or doesn't share the same opinion for the future then that company has no reason to give them any freebies it is all about money you don't showcase the product to the fullest then they have no reason to give it to you no reviewer is entitled to a free gpu if he wants to review it he has to buy it like the rest of us ,0,Dec-20

0, mmm really old games with overly reflective puddles of water all of which could be rendered on hardware that doesn't demand a premium but will be artificially limited to hardware that demands a premium thanks for taking a console like experience making it worse before giving it to us nvidia that's what we've been missing this whole time right guys ,0,Oct-19
0, i am so fed up of this whole gpu reality they keep making them better but i never get to buy one because almost no one is selling them always at premium i feel like an archeologist always playing games 3 years old because only then i manage to buy a second hand good gpu ,0,Dec-20

0, it doesn't matter what software does a failure at the hardware level is a failure at the hardware driver level it would be like designing a room with a secret self destruct button and eventually some curious person pressing the button nvidia or the hardware partners need to fix the hardware or address it via drivers ,0,Jul-21
0, and how will you combat botting on this very valuable item that could likely be sold at twice the msrp it will be an issue even if miners are not which they will be unless this will be extremely cheap and i mean no where remotely close to the real deal as for fucked drivers they can be unfucked if it was rocket science neither nvidia nor amd would be doing it ,0,Mar-21
0, to first amd's fucking rx 580 vid card requires windows 10 won't work on or 8 now the newer vid card a gen or two later doesn't even support uefi wtf amd this is the exact kind of bullshit as to why people go nvidia ,0,Feb-19

0, oh no but fanboys from nvidia amd crap drivers crap cards that go black when playing wait a minute that's the 3080 lol ,0,Sep-20
0, the 2060s is just a bad 2070 chip the 2070s is just a bad 2080 chip is this why they are just dropping the prices of the originals instead of having higher prices for new cards seems kinda shitty to make the new line up just bad versions of the old line up with a number downgrade ,0,Jun-19
0, rtx 3070 the only current gen nvidia graphics card you actually can buy this year too bad for them amd has their full high end line up available but the rtx 3070 is just like the geforce 8800gts 320mb looks really great now but will look pathetic for the near future due to insufficient memory this will happen when ps5 and xbox series x are up to speed let's face it 8gb vram is the high end standard since 2015 ,0,Oct-20
0, ngl i dont think the founders edition cards are good anyway the third party manufacters offer alot better cooling anyway imo so the little bit extra money is worth it ,0,Oct-20
0, wow a 2060 with 12gb of vram uh how is 12gb of vram going to matter in a card that can't actually do enough to use it all maybe if they do it in a lower nanometer process like that one gpu then it could have some potential ,1,Sep-21
0, give me a gtx 1180 ti so i can run games at 1440p 144fps with all graphics settings maxed out a 1080 ti can't come close right now ,0,Jun-18

0, devs complaining about people streaming games they already bought and recalling them is freaking stupid and nvidia should explain that to them ,0,Mar-20
0, why are people so desperate for the 300 series just wait until all the scalpers prices have dropped because of no sales also nvidia obviously released a small number to control the pricing demand as for twitch being banned it's going to get to a point where there's us only apps app owned companies and eu rof controlled companies apps ,0,Sep-20

0, nty to arm still rocking my predator helios 300 with a 1060 gtx more than enough for any game and still costs less than most gpus ,0,Jul-21
0, i'm not sure releasing another graphics card will ease the burden on chip fabs further while i don't think having last gen's card still available is necessarily a bad idea it makes me wonder how it would compare to a lower spec 30 series card i don't see the point of having two pieces of hardware with neck in neck performance or two cards with barely distinguishable price points so if the 2060 isn't significantly cheaper than a 3060 then i don't see the point in a 2060 and if the 3060 isn't significantly faster than a 2060 i don't see the point in a 3060 we could probably stand to have fewer skus 2060 3060 3070 3080 3080ti 3090 that's too many cards let's pare this down to prices and performance points that make sense and clear up some space in the manufacturing and retail channels so that they're actually obtainable ,0,Sep-21
0, another refresh this is the best chance for amd to raise wtf if they can compete with 2080 for 400 to 500 they can destroy nvidia ,0,Sep-18
0, hm this may be a really bad take but i think gpus not having the ability to mine well is good if it's useless from the get go no one is gonna wanna want it ,0,Mar-21
0, all the amd and nvidia manufacturers should implement a address and card limit for all vendors unless they are a business account i don't know why they are not limiting quantity sold ,0,Mar-21

0, how does this compare to the highest tier integrated xe graphics if i recall correctly they have the same number of cus ,0,Nov-20
0, lets be honest based off nvidia previews of ray tracing in action is all slow motion and barely noticable i mean honestly you probably will not notice the ray tracing working in games so whats the point of it in general game lighting already looks good as is so why use graphics power to implement it ,0,Aug-18

0, the thing everybody is missing here is that your 1080 ti can run the game under more that fair conditions but it's caped so you are lead to buy a new and more expensive gpu any thoughts toward this practice ,0,Dec-20
0, will the custom cards be able to have good enough cooling when the reference has so extremely high temperatures even ,0,Jul-19
0, musk got some scathing reply tweets this week about tesla applications for gaming artists now we know why they're probably all nvidia employees a company called xclio who made the first rgb fans all but vanished a couple of years ago and were working on a similar case design could it be that inwin bought them out ,0,Aug-18
0, nvidia puts out a minimum spec for their product aib partners saves a few bucks and cheaps out on their gpu passing the issue onto the customer ltt why didn't nvidia fix this ,1,Sep-20
0, there need to be a way for gpus to detect if they're being used for crypto mining and then automatically self destruct ,0,Mar-21

0, lol that 1010 seems to be the answer to the problem of cases with riser cables for the gpu you know the one that requires you to either direct connect gpu or connect pcie3 replacement to switch the mode in bios upon bios reset upgrade maybe it's going to be added to new mitx cases as a stop gap solution before proper pcie4 risers are available ,0,Jan-21
0, they can make a gpu that beats a 3080 ti by 300 and costs 10 bucks the completely broken and unfunctional drivers are not worth the hassle ,0,Jun-20
0, nvidia pay us 500 usd extra for some proprietary hardware to enable g sync freesync how about you fuck off ,0,Nov-19
0, imagine if they sold all those 300k gpus and actually tried to combat the current insanely overinflated gpu prices and since nvidia has no plan to release volta anytime soon wouldn't that also make sense i still haven't bought a gpu yet to this day even though i built my gaming pc last year because i entered the market right when gpu prices started getting fucking insane now it's been a year and i'm still sitting here waiting for gpu prices to get anywhere close to normal last time i bought a gpu was back in 2011 with the gtx 560 ti lmao ,0,Jun-18

0, 300 increase in performance with upcoming fidelity fx super resolution finally 180 fps in the witcher 3 with a gtx 1080 ti at 4k ,2,May-21
0, the reason amd did a price drop immediately before release is called strategic marketing when you're the underdog in the market looking to take it by storm by offering not only an amazing product like the 5700xt but also to compete against the shit that nvidia has been doing every single time amd releases a new product for the past 10 years it's about damn time amd did something smart with their product releases nvidia also has nothing of value after the gtx 1080ti everything else they release is trash and over priced junk raytracing from nvidia is a marketing hype scam plan and simple amd is offering valid and useful features on their products not just half assed crap features that hinder the balls out of performance ,0,Jul-19
0, will this hopefully drop down the prices of rtx 2080s im trying to convince myself to invest into a new graphics card currently on a asus rog 1070 strix ,0,Aug-20
0, i did not expect this from nvidia i thought the driver limitation would either be massively overreaching or easily worked around but to just have it not working at all on launch is definitely a surprise ,0,Feb-21
0, isn't the 20 vs 12gb thing more like a performance vs cost tradeoff i'd guess at 20gb the bus width of the card would match the regular 3080 whereas 12gb cards have the same bus width as a 3090 i'm guessing the performance tradeoff simply wasn't worth it when you factor in the cost of the extra ram in the price of these cards profit for nvidia i'd be interested to see how this 20gb card actually performed in games compared to the 12gb version we got my assumption is the performance delta would be negligible for most applications games especially considering the performance delta between the 3080ti and the 3090 it wouldn't surprise me if the card we got is actually a better performer in games though that's just speculation ,0,Sep-21
0, i remember the sega genesis collection on pc would really tax the gpu in the bedroom hub area not because it was graphically intensive or complex but because there was no frame limiter and this simple 3d hub area would draw as many frames as it could into the hundreds of fps and would make the gpu and its cooling system work extremely hard they did patch it ,1,Jul-21
0, minecraft has had shaders for years now through a community mod called optifine they're not ray traced but that's hardly an issue unless you're a total graphics snob ,0,Aug-19

0, nvidia not letting you own your own hardware thats a bs headline buy the card that is meant for the job you want to do if you need to pull a huge heavy trailer to you buy a tiny kei truck no you get the machine for the job if you want to mine get a mining card if you want to do graphics get a graphics card all arguments are invalid because it's literally too stupid to argue over ,2,Feb-21

0, why wouldn't i pre order the rtx 2080 ti is definitly going to be a performance upgrade from a gtx 1080 ti even nvidia wouldn't be stupid enough to make a mistake like that and what other choice is there for a graphics upgrade i could wait until benchmarks happen and see that it's only a 10 increase in performance and then i'd still buy it or we could find out it's a massive bump in performance and the price sky rockets as everyone buys them up and scalpers take over i've got enough disposable income to burn on upgrading my pc and i'd rather not wait until they're all sold out ,0,Aug-18
0, in australia the rtx3060ti is the same price as the ps5 series x only problem is you cant buy it ,0,Nov-20

0, you know nvidia will likely be skimming from those mining rigs that's the only reason they are changing their driver the more you mine the more crypto currency nvidia will be skimming and then trading for cash you know like that evil scheme to skim pennies from account transactions in the old superman movie and that other movie and the movie after that only nvidia will be doing it for real now ,1,Feb-21
0, why put a limit on a gpu you should be able to do what ever you want with the gpu ,0,Apr-21

0, sadly i find it hard to care about video card announcements when they will not be in stock for their entire product cycle unless you're insanely lucky or willing to buy from the scalpers at insane markup it could be the best value ever at msrp you'll never actually be able to buy one for a reasonable price ,1,May-21
0, i always assumed that the reduction in vram for the 3080 was a way to try to increase production to better meet demand there were memory shortages around that time as i recall i wonder how much worse nvidia card availability would have been if they stuck with the 20gb of vram ,0,Sep-21

0, weird i just bought a gt 1030 for my server media pc a few weeks ago it was the minimum card for running 4k 60hz couldn't find any info on it but one has to assume this new card has hdmi as well making it decidedly not useless most motherboards can only do 4k 30hz and plenty of people run dedicated media pcs in their living rooms ,0,Jan-21
0, been waiting since the rtx 20xx came to market to replace my trusty gtx 1080 ti fe what's another few more months ,0,Oct-20
0, people are missing the fact that these 300k extra gpus were not named it could be a large number of lower end gpus for office computers or even some last gen gpus just because there are 300 thousand of them doesnt mean theyre the ones we all want ,0,Jun-18
0, the vll was unwelcome have he seen his 2080 keynote he never even used this card of course he will say it sucks ,0,Jan-19

0, there is no way tomb raider devs and driver updates can boost performance x which is required if it want to run at 4k 60 fps with rtx on because that's probably what the 2080ti gets with rtx off ,0,Aug-18
0, the british government investigating the arm purchase is only bad for nvidia in so far as they'll have to bribe them bunch of corrupt useless wankers ,0,Apr-21
0, 2500 cute i couldn't find one for less than 3k here in india and a cursory check reveals it is still sort of the same but at least you can buy the card earlier it wasn't even in stock in most places even with the exaggerated price mine cost me around k and additional cost for psu but that was near peak shortage one major cost still remains 4k high refresh rate monitor i can't find any that i like expect for a acer predator cg437k inch one that is 1 old 2 seems over pricked at 1300 1400 going to wait for new monitor or the new neo monitor to be available here ,0,Aug-21

0, i actually think the 1010 is a cute little card i would love to build a little system using it and a celeron should be a perfect pair also very power consumption friendly ,0,Jan-21
0, super because rtx 2080 ti mark ii extremely more than 40 fps ray tracing was too lame for 4 more fps p in all seriousness though i hope ray tracing improves a lot with the super cards nvidia needs something that performs well enough for more game devs to want to invest in programming for it sometimes it takes longer for developers to unlock the potential of the hardware and sometimes the hardware still just won't do what the developers want it to do this kinda feels like a combination of both ,0,Jun-19
0, 8k my ass maybe 2d indie games even 1440p is still difficult to have 60 fps no drops on pc with 100 dollar gpus in many games amd can barely even keep up with a gtx1080 and they expect us to believe a 400 500 dollar console will have a gpu twice as powerful as a 2080ti ,0,Jun-19

0, you know whats even harder than getting stock of graphics cards getting stock of ltt store mouse pads in the larger sizes ,0,Jan-21
0, to be fair to nvidia if those numbers of amd are correct you still need to lay down 100 bucks if you want to go team red with price performance 3080 is right now equivelant to the 6800xt with inflated prices it will still reach around 700 bucks the same as the 3080 i will still be going green for raytracing performance and dlss but i'm looking forward for team red in their next line up ,0,Oct-20
0, when you just copy info from other sources at least copy correctly the capacitors can have an influence on the stability but they are not the cause of the crashes it happened on fe cards as well also nice work citing igor'slab as a hardware site ,1,Sep-20
0, well y dont nvidia sell me a 1080ti for less than most people mid to low end gaming pcs then lol my 980 is starting to fill old ,0,Jun-18
0, everytime you say memory expree i feel sad man why can't my country have this cool shit but then again we are talking about the same country that has shipping costs so high a gtx 1050 ti costs no joke 210 ,5,Aug-18

0, i hope the hashrate limitation works but i'm not holding my breath what annoys me the most is that retailers aren't actively figuring out ways to limit 1 2 gpu's per person total i know the task is daunting but people don't need more than 2 gpu's what makes it worse is when people buy from the scalpers which acts as positive reinforcement so they go back to the drops with their bots and snag up more cards i'm fairly certain most of the purchases of scalped cards are from miners who are confident they'll roi rather than a gamer who would invest 200 for a 3080 for the sake of gaming i just want the situation to resolve itself so that gamers can enjoy 1440p 4k with ultra preset graphics and respectable frames it's a really bad feeling being stuck with a pascal card or older and not being able to obtain 60 frames at 1080p on low medium settings ,0,Feb-21

0, netflix makes peaky blinders so i'll pay whatever the hell they want far cry 5 was better than spiderman ps4 sorry just a better game spiderman ps4 was a better movie i guess but the gameplay was shallow repetitive and the open world was like an old school ubisoft ac game like ac 2 or something the actual open world and content within it was not much better than spiderman 2 on ps2 lol and the swinging might as well be on rails you have so little control story was good though and the graphics and animations look nice ,0,Nov-20

0, now nvidia is just being greedy they have 300 00 gpus to give away and price doesn't drop one cent on their website and 1080ti's are still marked as 'out of stock' how are they still 700 which some people take for granted is a lot of money when supply demand rules usually go down when there is more and go up when there is little supply and higher demand like we just saw cryptomining is dead now and nvidia best see that soon ,11,Jun-18
0, conspiracy theory radeon and nvidia have had to settle lawsuits in the not so distant past because of price fixing ,0,Jul-19
0, it totally makes sense for them to discontinue the radeon vii because it was pretty obvious it was just a stop gap solution for them in the first place also if they are going to discontinue them i think that is a good indication that they will have sometime to replace them soon maybe before the end of the year it would be pretty sweet to see a 5800 or 5900 that could compete directly with the 2080 super ,0,Jul-19

0, okay stupid question why are there so many rumors of an rx 6700 gpu when amd stated that the 5600xt and 5700xt were going to be the bottom of the product stack for this generation of gpu's maybe it's just me but as an admitted amd fan i'm not sure building weaker cards is the way to go at this point since turning on ray tracing pretty much turns their new cards into last gen nvidia rt cards and for god's sake would the gpu makers please quit making new sku's of cards when you can't even fulfill the demand for the current line up talk about putting the cart before the horse ,0,Nov-20

0, people are stupid pc games are super unoptimized so you have to double the cost of a gpu to get 20 or 30 fps when your already at 120 plus fps on the cheap cards trust me once you pass 120fps your not noticing a big difference id rather have 120 at 4k than 240 at 1440 any day ,1,Aug-21

0, i am so fed up with ngreedia i will wait for amd to drop a gpu even if its another year i refuse to give a dime to them assholes if some of the rtx and gtx things about segmenting gpus in the future are true all they care about is money and this is the very same company only last week who said gamers are their main focus bullshit liars ,0,Aug-18

0, whilst i don't like people buying up loads of cards for cryptomining i do believe that this restriction on mining sets a dangerous precedent what's stopping nvidia from deciding to block out people using geforce gpus to render things in 3d animation programs like blender and forcing people to buy quadro cards or whatever their calling their pro stuff now for that also no amount of crypto limiting is going to help tsmc to fabricate more gpu chips ,0,Feb-21
0, after what happened with the standalone physx accelerator cards after nvidia acquired ageia removing compatibility in a driver update if you had an amd gpu apu on board gpu i can see why they have concerns about nvidia's acquisition of arm ,0,Apr-21
0, if nvidia was smart they would release a 1670 for 350 and a 1680 for 500 these 1660's and 1650s will be a shitty deal once navi is out a 1670 would be the perfect solution too take on navi which is rumored to offer 2070 1080 perf for 300ish i can understand though if they are w8ing for navi too launch before they tackle those cards tho ,0,Apr-19

0, horrible time for my gtx 1060 6gb to fail it's impossible to find a replacement card in canada right now i'm screwed ,1,Feb-21
0, some gas companies around me utilize encrypted emv however it's not exclusive to per brand and i don't think it was a requirement more so to regulate the prices more effectively see the ones that upgraded to it have to verify the card with an zip code which it then utilizes to charge you the suggested gas in that region say if it's us for 93 in my region but it's us at my work for premium i'd then be charged for specifically because the sister company 'in that zip code' has higher priced gas thus allowing for more profit ultimately i wish this practice was illegal but it's not ,0,Dec-19

0, 3dfx were awesome back in the day sorely needed competition and they were actually competent actually have a voodoo3 card still running in an ancient system made to last ,0,Aug-21
0, feels unfair to blame nvidia for this they provided the information to use the correct capacitors for the power delivery system it was up to the aibs to choose what to use and they used the cheaper ones and that's when the crashes happened if you look at the founders edition version they actually use two capacitors that are more expensive jayztwocents made a video about this ,0,Sep-20
0, what is up with upping the resolution in each console generation who cares about way too high resolutions 1k 2k 60fps 120fps is enough for absolutely everything in gaming much more important features in my opinion anyway would be backwards compatibility not just one gen backwards improved xmb experience this thing is slow as shit native mouse and keyboard support for all games not just the games that enable it support for more media formats better media editing tools they are pretty primitive right now and much much more and above all else require every single game to have an option allowing the user to choose between beautiful graphics or high frame rates and require every single game to include settings for custom button layouts ,0,Apr-19

0, instead of the gt 1010 can nvidia just try to make a good low end video card like amd did with the rx 480 and 470 ,0,Jan-21
0, now i hope they do the same with new gpus going forwards and for amd to also follow through geforce and radeon gpus are designed for gaming not so cryptominers can ruin the entire product line for everyone else ,0,Feb-21

0, as much as people are iffy about the 2060 rerun it's a way to utilize fab space that isn't in high demand right now while it might be hopeful for people to have hoped that they would rerun the 2080 ti most likely there wouldn't be enough demand to justify the order or maybe there is miners seem to want any card that is profitable ,2,Sep-21

0, ray tracing is used in the industry very often what if rtx is specialized for ray tracing which is the future of gaming and gtx will still exist normally f e a gtx 1180 as the high end gtx and the rtx 1180 for ray tracing for high end consumers and quadro rtx for industry ,0,Aug-18
0, oh come on what makes people think the rtx2080 would be better in games in all aspects than the gtx1080ti the rtx gpu's have been built with raytracing in mind which for me a 3d design specialist is rather awesome because the gtx gpu's always had to work overtime for me to real time render stuff with v ray in 3ds max or keyshot in gaming stick to the gtx series unless a game has been built around the new turing architecture ,0,Aug-18
0, for a moment i thought lisa had the high ground too but she really just told us customers that we haven't seen the card yet that's also not a clever thing to say ,0,Jan-19
0, i've never spent more then around 250 usd on a gpu and i doubt i ever will these pricing tiers from nvidia these days are just insane ,0,Aug-18
0, personally i wouldnt mind gpu manufacturers mining the hell out of the market for extra revenue maybe itll start making it impossible for anybody else to make money off it and we can go back to using gpu's for what they were meant for and put this cryptocurrecy bs 6 feet under they get to make money no matter what we get our gpu's and crpto miners being the losers they are get to cry me a river ,0,Jun-18
0, people are saying no reason to buy nvidia unless you want rtx but the 5700 is competing with the 2060 when the 2060 came out all the reviews were saying that the 2060 is pointless as an rtx card as it didn't have enough raytracing performance to get up to 30fps at 1080 has that changed if not we're in the position of saying that the 2060 offers nothing over the 5700 at all as the rtx capability widely regarded as being useless ,1,Jul-19
0, the only true rtx is the one in austin texas though i do hope to see ray tracing around whenever i'm there d ,0,Aug-18
0, believe me amd won't be either fast for any cards with high memory size due to same issue as nvidia system slow memory sub system is bottlenecking entire high memory configuration so for amd having more memory does not go fast or run fast on high resolution amd is far behind in that dept in horsepower ,0,Sep-21
0, any graphics card must be stable and able to reliably reach and sustain its max clock under load i have an evga gtx 980 ftw that does the same reported black screen audio still going but system must be shutdown to recover i was forced to remove all the ftw edition overclock down to reference 980 clocks to achieve 100 stability no more random black screens with audio the video card fans spinning up to 100 is a response to the increased heat being generated running uncapped framerates will do that plus the default fan curves on pretty much all nv video cards is really bad both problems were solved by running msi afterburner to lower the gpu over clock as well as defining a more rational and balanced custom fan curve one node at 10 fan speed up to 30 degrees c and another node at 95 fan speed at 100 degrees c under sustained full gpu load the fans run at around 66 and the gpu temp never exceeds 76 degrees c as for the gpus frying again this is likely due to the chronically stable 'most' of the time gpu over clocking done by some casts a stern look towards evga as well as the really puzzling fan curves they bake into their bios long post i hope someone finds its helpful ,0,Jul-21
0, 1160 1260 1360 1460 1560 16 oh shit now wtf do we do i know lets just go to 1760 1860 1960 20 shit guess we will find out within a 5 or so years probably will do away with the teen next year anyway and just continue with rtx 20's only or 3060 ,0,Feb-19
0, covid supply issues nvidia you seem perfectly happy to sell gpus directly to miners i dont buy your use of covid as an excuse for a moment ,0,Nov-20
0, so let me get this straight gf bows out of making amd's 7 nanometer chips and their gpu's in 2018 says it will not work on 5 or 3 nanometer architecture either then sues tsmc for basically filling a void in the chip manufacturing market sounds like gf is a dumpster fire at full burn ,0,Aug-19
0, i don't think the rtx 2080 is going to be very interesting since its ray tracing bandwidth will be very small ,0,Aug-18
0, the separation of gaming and mining gpus is a double edged sword in the short term it might see more gpus in the hands of gamers however it means that gamers can't recover some of the cost by mining and those affected second hand cards have a more limited if any use it could also see prices rise when mining cards are more profitable ,0,Mar-21
0, nvidia why you are trying to sell a gt1010 you make gaming gpus why make a worse card did you have someone that needed a gpu for something but was to cheap to buy a gt1030 ,0,Jan-21

0, the xt naming is no surprise as amd has been using it for gpu code names for polaris before that during the terascale days it was used as a part of the naming scheme ,0,May-19
0, 6 of gpus went to crypto miners wrong 6 of nvidia's gpu stock went directly to crypto miners know who doesn't care if they feed scalpers that's right crypto miners not to mention purchases from legitimate third party vendors so you can add all of those other purchases on top of the 6 we have direct evidence of it's likely crypto miners have bought up around half a million 30 series gpus ,1,Nov-20

0, all nvidia did was up the clock speed of their gpu's and slap the word super on them all they did was just make their product line confusing all they had to do was just improve their current cards going forward and keep the names the same instead they have to have 2 versions of every fuckin card they release its fuckin stupid as hell ,0,Mar-20
0, it wouldn't make sense to call it 3090 super since mostly all of the rtx 300 series has a ti variant except the 3090 of course ,6,Aug-21

0, nvidia is only limiting cards on a driver level can definitely be hacked with a modded bios flash and a recompiled driver it's about appearing like they're doing something for gamers without making it too difficult for miners to get around meh just increase production already ,0,Feb-21
0, its getting more expensive for the us market eu has had to deal with 2x the us msrp as base retail prices meaning a usd 650 msrp gpu will sell for 100 with vat imports etc included it was about time us showed the world how rich they really are ,0,Jan-21

0, nvidia should be shut down entirely as a company what a sham all nvidia gpu architecture should be opened sourced ,0,Oct-20
0, i can see why nvidia might be reluctant to dump this surplus on the market and hurt board partners but i have seen the chinese deceptions on earlier chip generations a genuine 750 is still an ok chipset but most now are fakes using this surplus as the base for a reliable budget brand that could kill the fakes might be worth some short term pain would i buy a genuine 1050 or better i am not sure but i would want it to be a trustworthy with some good way of checking prices currently still feel too high for this stage in the life cycle and the next generation maybe i should just get a ps4 instead ,0,Jul-18

0, i kinda get the nvidia thing if their focus in marketing is ray tracing it doesn't make sense to send cards to people who aren't interested in that as much which i also get not being interested in it not like they send this stuff out for consumer reasons its all just marketing to them ,0,Dec-20
0, nobody in the whole motherf kin world i can't wait to buy a gt 1010 d seriously there's no market for it anyone who just wants a basic card for everyday use will get a gt 710 or 730 i think they can do 4k video playback fine and it would be cheaper and anyone wanting a light but decent gaming experience will get a 1030 there's no point of the 1010 ,0,Jan-21

0, to me the marketing was beautiful with amd they left the price high enough to be competitive as it stands knowing that they would more than likely have to lower the price before launch i don't think this is a dumb move at all they have room to maneuver their pricing of the new navi chips in my personal humble opinion many people wanted to see 100 less on the top end and they may see that hundred dollars off but why from a business standpoint would amd low ball the price ie the desired 350 price many wanted for the 5700 xt let nvidia force them into price war that i think amd can win ,0,Jun-19

0, what's the point of releasing a new gpu if it is only getting gobbled up by miners and scalpers modern pc gaming is now dead since no one can get their hands on latest and powerful parts that doesnt cost a kidney if you want to have something for gaming you either buy a pre built buy a gaming laptop or just stick with console ,0,Sep-21
0, fucking hell guess we can kiss our smooth sailing with arm on linux goodbye now we'll have the same fucking issues we have with nvidia's gpus drivers ,0,Sep-20
0, they should start selling all in one graphics cards which have games on the vram and can still run the games ,0,Oct-20
0, the more they release the more strain it takes off the gpu economy right sorry i don't really know how this ish works edit if i understand this correctly the scalpers don't know a lot about nerdy stuff they just want to make money so they buy up all the new hot thing and lose interest in the older models i'm probably just getting my hopes up so once again i apologize to all the haters out there ,0,Aug-21
0, i wouldn't get too excited about that freesync on nvidia cards no doubt the next driver update will conveniently and silently make that impossible ,0,Aug-18

0, honestly i will not be bailing either amd or nvidia out when the boom eventually ends i am going to buy used to spite them i'm never supporting the current gpu market it's left a bad taste in my mouth and miners aren't to blame its amd and nvidia's shown lack of care of the consumer not delaying a launch they knew was impossible to meet demand ,0,Mar-21

0, honestly i couldn't give a toss about 4k let alone 8k pointless unless youre using a panel of immense size which is crap for gaming being 1 foot away from a 2 foot screen is way better than being 10foot away from a 6foot screen even refresh rates all pie in the sky without frames to keep up id much prefer to see 60 or better yet 90 120 fps at 2k than 30 at 4 or 8k oh and most importantly native kb m support across the platform right now these are the 2 major things than hold consoles back from pc gaming i guess though most users are fad following sheeple who just think higher number good lower number bad duuhh and will lap up all this irrelevant hype just like how they marvel at the graphics in pre rendered cutscenes like they are something to behold bah ,0,Jun-19

0, an increase from 50 of a to 70 of a is actually a 40 difference or increase not 20 50 70 does overclocking increase the hash rate is it a fracton of the actual cards potential or is it a hard static limit if it's the later you could tune the card to use less power and continue on from where you'd stop due to loosing hashrate on a non lhr card eventually though lhr cards will become more powerful not to mention way more energy efficient than current gpus assuming all cards were lhr going forwards you'd have to release lhr or quarter hash rate cards and so on otherwise everyone would be mining on lhr cards in the future and this lowers to total capacity and so everything would be as if lhr didn't exist as each individual card will have the same fractional power of the total capacity of the network ,0,Aug-21

0, i feel like if these cards offered a significant fps improvement we would have seen those numbers on stage like we did with the 10 series launch i'm worried these cards are overpriced and underperforming fancier lighting isn't worth a thousand dollars if the 1080ti actually gets 50 percent more frames in most scenarios i'm in but i'm not paying that money for less than that ,0,Aug-18
0, my only beef with nvidia allowing some freesync monitors compatible with gsync was those manufacturers suddenly dropped freesync from any of their marketing suddenly overnight it looked like there were less freesync monitors available i have zero doubt that was a requirement from nvidia so a monitor could say gsync compatible ,0,Nov-19

0, big navi won't have as decent ray tracing performance as nvidia's more mature implementation however these benchmarks only show non rt performance comparisons so i'm still probably going with an rtx 300 series gpu instead 3070 seems good ,1,Oct-20

0, of course they don't actually care if miners get their hands on the cards that's just their pr spin on a blatantly anti consumer move what they actually care about is cashing in on the mining boom in the short term and locking down the second hand supply of cheap used mining cards in the long term to stop prices from falling back to reasonable levels ,0,Feb-21

0, i am sorry but i disagree here maybe 175million is not much considering total nvidia sales for entire q3 and i am just taking number at face value here but the same amount makes more than 200 00 video cards sort of taking average for 300 series 200 00 cards are a lot i don't know what is total number of 300 series gpus sold but i imagine this is going to be not insignificant part of it if people can be angry on bots and scalpers then why not crypto miners certainly i cannot see scalpers getting their hands on 200k cars so in comparison crypto miners turns out to be much bigger issue ,0,Nov-20
0, lol i find a scalper i'm robbing him too and when i say rob i mean i'm giving him 535 for the damn console and taking that shit same thing for the folks doing it for the video cards too i feel like they are using the market to scam people because they really want it ,0,Nov-20
0, no one will ever buy dedicated mining gpus as long as regular gpus can mine cryptocurrency because they wouldn't be able to sell them and return significant amount of their investment mining gpus are straight pointless at first nvidia and amd must somehow decrease performance of every of their products by creating a legit firmware which is almost impossible because one can betray another to sell more gpus to miners i don't think that hacking anti mining firmware will be that difficult ,1,Feb-21

0, um with the nvidia cards it wasn't the overclocked cards it was the cheap 3rd party cards they hit there target boost clocks but gpu boosted higher than the cheaper capacitors can handle they shouldn't of cheapened from the reference design but they still meet the specs on the box so i guess they'll nerf the boost anyway they aren't the oc variants from those manufacturers they're the cheap models ,0,Sep-20
0, you know uefi support on graphics cards is also the certificate that enforces blocking third party vbios i would be very glad if they dropped the uefi certificate in favor of unlocking our vbios this would be a very good thing for overclocking and you don't need to worry about scammers with such a expensive card what are they going to do flash it into looking like a vega 64 that would be a downgrade so they cant scam anyone ,0,Feb-19

0, pretty certain nvidia sold those chips to china i don't recall reading cards were sold so it might have been just the gpu some softness in nvidia's stock price over that if you can call 530 per share a soft price yeah i could have bought them for about 15 per share back about 200 hindsight who knew i hope to efing eff that the chinese uses those chips to mine and not in military applications where they are rapidly overtaking us all hail taiwan semiconductor ,0,Nov-20

0, nvidia should not cancel the rtx 3070 16gb vram and rtx 3080 20gb vram because it awesome just because amd dominated them doesn't mean they should cancel it ,0,Nov-20
0, i was hoping to hear that amd was releasing a competitor to the gtx 1080ti but it sounds like that's not happening i am rather curious to see when amd will release some truly new gpus maybe they could focus more on 4k instead or ray tracing like nvidia is doing that could certainly work to their advantage especially since the rtx gpus don't really have software to support ray tracing atm even more so since we don't know how well game developers will support it in their games after all while the rtx 2080ti is better than a gtx 1080ti at 4k it is not cost effective at the current prices which would be a smarter way for amd to compete at the top end ,0,Sep-18

0, if the crytek ray tracing demo benchmark test is any indication one will not absolutely need rtx hardware to get playable frame rates based on my own tests running the test on a laptop with a 7700hq and a gtx1070 non maxq at 1920 x 1080p with all details absolutely maxed out including the ray tracing set at ultimate i never got less than 40 fps on the worst dips and peaked at over 70 fps averaging something around 60 fps i heard that it still benefits significantly from rtx hardware though looks like the crytek team has really gotten ray tracing for games figured out ,0,Nov-19
0, if they can sort out input latency i could probably live with streaming games i do it some now but the input latency is always extremely noticeable and makes play difficult in most titles a handful actually play pretty well on nvidia's and playstation's solutions but between currently only having wireless network solutions atm and them still sorting out the kinks definitely makes fully local games preferable though i wouldn't be entirely opposed if the cost was reasonable still prefer physical copies of things but streaming is just too damn convenient and i have nearly no free space for storage ,0,Jul-18
0, the steam controller failed because of valve's incompetence all they had to do was hire one kid to make default profiles for at least the popular games but nope valve's gonna valve nvidia on the other hand takes a more hands on approach to these things as we have already scene with their photomodes etc i trust nvidia to deliver on this ,0,Jan-21
0, i seriuosly doubt that a mass prodction of this cooler would cost a coumpany as big as nvidia this much ,0,Jun-20
0, i imagine everyone who has a 3090 has a gsync monitor they should have vsync also turned globally in nvcp in addition to a 3 framerate limiter if they followed optimal gsync setup it would've maybe prevented this but i dunno gpus are designed to run 100 if it dies for doing that its definitely just faulty or user has bad psu or bad case cooling lol ,0,Jul-21

0, nvidia cooler could cost around 150 not really it's costs around 30 but they will charge u 150 cause they want 2 milk more all in all any blower fe card mostly sucks always go for after market designs it's like paying extra to get hot 83c card while cheaper other designs costs less and get around 70c ,1,Jun-20

0, if they actually cared about their customers this would ha e been done to any of the good cards they were fine selling all their best gpus to miners their loyal customers can buy a gtx 1050 or rtx 2060 for their original price and if your lucky you can get a 3060 but not even the 3060 ti those are for miners and scalpers not their loyal customers if they thought for a minute that their customers would ditch them for shady practices this wouldn't happen this will continue as long as they know you will buy their cards no matter what this is your fault ,0,Feb-21

0, fishy business with asus notice that their 'premium' x470 b350 do not support pcie4 x16 or x8 for the graphics card slots why would that be right because they don't want you to buy a premium b450 x470 instead of a x570 they just want to enable it for people who already bought a budget model ,0,Jul-19
0, the trouble with rtx is that the gpus for it won't take off without games support and the game support won't take off without the gpus lol as for the rtx effect on games i agree i can't see much of an impact as of yet but i'll bet that is because this rtx has been patched into existing games really if we're going to see a true difference we need someone to develop a game with ray tracing in mind from the very start and that'll only come at the loss of performance on your traditional pc hardware thus leaving you in a bit of a marketing dilemma ultimately guess we'll just have to keep waiting to see ,0,Feb-19
0, etheriun is about to be frozen as it moves from prof of work solving cryptographic questions using a gpu to proof of stake humans and machines checking transactions for validity but you have to buy in first it's the most worthless change possible if they'd chosen btc that would be more impactful ,0,Apr-21

0, so amd have created 4k 120fps card to fit inside xbox but can't create gpu for pc that could do it ok then it will be 1080 120fps 4k 30 fps 8k 15 fps that's probably how it will be as it doesn't clearly say it will be 4k 120fps together ,1,Jun-19
0, lovely lovelace y new nvidia cards but the real question is when if ever can a mere mortal like i am can buy these beauties other than from the scalpers at ridiculous prices i mean ,0,Dec-20
0, uuuh yes we actually do want an rtx 2060 re release what the fuck you on buddy or do you mean the 12gb vram part because that is genuinely stupid it will just make the card more expensive for no reason you will never be able to use so much vram on a comparatively weak card 6 or 8 gb of vram would've been fine ,1,Sep-21

0, i feel like rembrandt might be the first legit gpu alternative apu the rx 5500 has 22 compute units and can play most games at 1080p on high settings some at 100hz even rembrandt has 12 compute units on a newer architecture i imagine they'll handle 1080p medium settings perfectly fine and will probably push 144hz on e sports titles ,1,May-21
0, as an rtx card owner i have come to warn you do not buy rtx for dlss dlss does not function as promised at all to be specific at 1080p it looks like 720p upscaled to 1080p with some extra smoothing blurring applied to it it actually performs worse than downscaling your resolution to 720p which ironically also produces a better looking image with more detail than dlss ,0,Feb-19

0, i feel like nvidia should get hit with antitrust at this point as they are becoming very close to dominating the entire market ,0,Sep-20
0, so basically they aresepertaing gpus into gaming only and mining inly cards so gamers can still get their cards i really can't see how this can happen there are some very clever hackers out there i am sure one of them could some how bypass this or some physical mod to the gpu ,0,Feb-21

0, nvidia as most people will hear it we made our cards unhackable because of some secret handshaking sauce la la la blob blob blob it's impossible to hack something something so don't even try it most people nvidia made something unhackable ok i guess soon forgets about it hacking community challege accepted some time later but not that much later nvidia gets mad someone bypass their unhackable lockout ,0,Feb-21
0, how exactly is nvidia responsible for the current card disaster aren't the board partners responsible afaik the crashes are caused by using less than two mlcc capacitors on the boards and nvidia has two mlcc capacitors as a requirement in their design specs so how is nvidia responsible for the board partners skimping on the specs ,0,Sep-20

0, it seems like you forgot that the no pre order rule is mainly for digital content the reason people pre order stuff is because they want things early and with digital content you can buy things the moment they come out and download it immediately it also can't be sold out a gpu is a physical card that can be sold out and or increase in price if you want it quickly a pre order is a completely logical move ,0,Aug-18

0, have they actually physically launched the super cards i can't find them actually being available where i live was it just a paper launch or do some markets actually have them ,0,Jul-19
0, i know they want their cards to be an easy online shopping experience but couldn't they have added just add a few captcha anti bot tests or maybe even require a valid mobile number so a verification code could to be sent to it before you're allowed to make a pre order come on nvidia you're smart enough to make this beast of a card a bit of forethought in selling it wouldn't go amiss ,0,Sep-20
0, nice so nvidia almost accidentally gave out gpus with as much vram as amd does that was a close one they almost tried to fine wine at levels equivalent to an entry level gpu made by amd ,0,Sep-21
0, as much as i want amd to beat nvdia right now what gap it's not like 1060 and 1070 went on smoke there isn't really a gap just because 2060 and below doesn't exist yet what we really need are gtx 2080ti equivalents something with the performance of 2080ti w o the rtx features and tax which most of us don't care about but as much as i am rooting for amd to get there it's almost as unlikely as nvidia providing actual gtx 2080ti as an option ,1,Sep-18

0, honestly while i do think hardware unboxed does overly neglect the features the nvida cards have moreso not including dlss in their considerations at all despite it being a very big thing both for fps in the now and longevity of a card blacklisting them over not including ray traced performance is a bit much however doesn't prevent me from feeling they were doing a bit of a flawed review format by downplaying or outright ignoring dlss ,1,Dec-20

0, the mystery board partner and i honestly doubt this will be the only case to surface was either hoarding the gpu's to keep prices artificially high or like you said nvidia overestimated how long the crypto demand would impact the market hopefully more investigation will be done ,0,Jun-18

0, oh so the 175 million is only 6 of the total third quarter revenue ok but what is the percentage compared to revenue generated by the 300 series alone because i'm sure as hell the 300 series revenue isn't the 100 of nvidia's third quarter revenue in gpu sales we don't know what percentage of nvidia's revenue this quarter is from the 300 series since they made so few the percentage of cards sold to miner is way higher than 6 i dont care if they sold the cards to the miners but since you are trying to confuse people into thinking nvidia only sold the 6 of the cards to miners i had to say something ,0,Nov-20

0, when games will be made to consoles that have rdna2 these cards become even more powerful as this completely new architecture will benefit from optimizations hugely games will be needing 16gb eventually as consoles are having 16gb and on pc you'll crank up details even further amd usually has lots of headroom in their drivers at launch especially with radically new architecture thus expect more from future drivers and aib cards should clock up to 10 15 higher still amd truly took the total gaming crown and this will age like fine wine ,10,Oct-20
0, amd is so getting their butts kicked by nvidia over and over and over again dang don't f with nvidia is the saying of the century ,0,Aug-20
0, can we just say screw nvidia and call the 1660ti an 1160ti because im pretty sure we all know what we mean if we say 1160ti it would be a bit like when nvidia had the new titan x on the pascal architecture and we all just decided to call it titan xp then nvidia decided to be awkward and release the titan xp little p ,1,Feb-19
0, why even release mining gpus anymore the only 2 cryptos that are actually worth it are bitcoin and ethereum bitcoin is pretty much asic farms only now and eth2 is already in the public testing stages using a proof of stake system that makes gpu mining completely useless ,0,Feb-21
0, the more manufacturing company the more gpu plus more competition the more they compete the better for the consumer and hopefully the price will go down ,0,Aug-21
0, so nvidia is stuck with 300k gpus couldn't they just distribute them to retailers and reduce the problems with a lack of available gpus in stock in the process or is that win win situation to new and novel for them ,0,Jun-18
0, nvidia just doesn't want competition how will they sell gpu's for over 100 when they have competition actually trying to sell products at a competitive price ,1,Feb-21

0, well there is also the fact that it's illegal to price fix but to a certain degree they are price fixing amd is taking home a lot of margin on the 5700xt as it is the replacement for the rx480 rx580 which launched at about 200 250 yes the die will have costed an extra 20 30 because the cost of 7nm is much higher and gddr6 likely costed amd another 15 so 300 to 350 yeah that would have been fair while also increasing margin a bit but amd wanted to take home the extra cash oh and the reason why the extra cost of 7nm would only cost about 20 is because the die on cards like this is a small part of the cost of the card 8gb of gddr6 cost like 120 the pcb vrm other components probably 20 30 total cost of the die 60 max and that is like is very very expensive for the die of that size it is probably more like 40 50 which is why it is so disappointing that amd didn't go with a semi decent cooler at that price point however if the aib cards come in also at 400 to 425 yeah i think thats a semi fair price still taking a bit more margin home but i am not against a company making a profit just don't rob us blind i am doubting it but one can hope they wont rob us blind ,0,Jul-19

0, this is bullsh t as a miner myself i don't believe it has anyone done the math rtx3090 does like 120m h for eth one of the most popular and most profitable gpu coins and costs 1500 usd and uses 300w an rx570 does 30mh for 100 usd and uses 100w four 570s required to get same hash rate as a 3090 costs less than 1 3 and is 3 4 as efficient yes the 3090 is more power efficient but costs 1100 more you can roi 4x3090s in about 100 days as compared to over 325 days for 3090 combine that with the fact that last few gen amd gpus spank nv in mining for example my rtx2060 pulls 32mh and cost me 500 cad rx570s cost me 105 cad and do 32mh i could believe amd gpus being bought up for mining i do know some miners that got 3090s but most got one if they were lucky and more for experimentation to see what it can do than to actually buy it to use and roi off of ,0,Nov-20
0, so nvidia is announcing another card that won't make it to store shelves at least amd is doing the same thing and making products exclusively for scalper bots ,0,Nov-20

0, why do we look at crypto miners with disgust did they steal the graphics cards anybody should be able to buy a graphics card for whatever reason they want the only way i can see that this would be unethical is if they used bots to purchase the cards but it's also possible that a bulk order was placed or otherwise arranged somehow possibly directly from the manufacturer ,0,Dec-20
0, im fine with it whether it was the titan cards before or the 3090 now these cards were made for consumer whales to buy nvidia is just cashing in while they can the 3080ti is more that adequate for consumers except for some niche scenarios though i think nvidia would get some positive pr if they released that with an affordable 3050ti non mobile as well ,0,Aug-21
0, i wonder if any of this has to do with the ccp cracking down on crypto miners if they make specific cards for miners the ccp could much more easily ban those specific models from being sold in china the ccp is trying to get rid of miners because it's giving citizens basically untraceable money so the ccp loses some control and doesn't like that one bit ,0,Mar-21
0, why does anthony think nvidia rtx 2080 70 60 that just had a price hike 2060 of 50 great value for the money even tho ray t is shit 1060 was 270ish and the 2060 is 400 now i don t see any value in that so is nvidia paying him out of the massive profits their geting out of the rtx cards there not great value their ripping us off ,0,Jul-19
0, i'm not gunna lie i live 20 minutes from microcenter so i waited on line before they opened and got an asus tuf gaming rtx 3080 and after seeing all these scalpers actually be able to sell these cards for crazy prices i thought to myself maybe i should sell mine and get a rtx 3090 from microcenter when it launches with the money so i posted my 3080 for 200 on ebay for fun just to see what happens not expecting anyone to really take it seriously and someone already purchased it i kinda feel bad but at the same time i'm literally getting an rtx 3090 now for free now i made my money back plus enough money to purchase a 3090 ,6,Sep-20

0, radeon vii is a good card and i'm sure if amd supered the card a little made it more available and brought the price down a little to be more competitive it would be fine those who want a vii can never find one unless it's price is jacked up beyond a nvidia 2080 which makes no point to buy after that ,0,Jul-19

0, the ti series is not meant to be affordable it should have had at least 16 gigs and for that matter the 3080 should have had 12 the bare minimum to run tittles at stock with no overhead is not good enough the 1080 had the same problem 8 gigs is not enough for how powerful the card actually is i use my overhead when i have it ,0,Sep-21
0, hmm smart access memory its abbreviation would be sam and memory is ram therefore sam has ram let's cut the middleman 'has' then we get samram which is close enough to sam raimi who made the spider man films and spidey is owned by sony this explains why the ps5 has rdna 2 and is powered by amd and guess what spider man miles morales is also a launch title such a big conspiracy and xsx got it cuz amd gotta make money and sony and amd worked together for big navi also amd new gpu was made specifically for sony which later made it to xsx and commercial parts ,0,Oct-20

0, cant wait for the series x and ps5 and that coming from a mainly pc gamer none of my friends play pc so i always get the new consoles my next big decision is the 3080 a big enough upgrade over the 2080ti which i have now or do i need to go 3090 amd is taking to long like always to get their gpus out and i dont think they will compete especially with the 3090 and with ray tracing rumors say turing ray tracing performance or slightly better but if they can do 3070 3080 performance with more vram cheaper and more efficient that would be nice i have a 9900ks and 3900x builds and will stick the ampere gpu with the ks then stick my strix 2080ti with the 3900x have a radeon vii now but if zen 3 is as good as we all hope ill get a 4900x and put ampere with it the only thing i dont like about the 3080 is vram i dont want to be going down in vram even though memory algorithms are supposed to be better with ampere ,0,Sep-20

0, seems stupid to me that they're doing all this work to make minecraft not look like minecraft anymore i'd probably give rtx a try but i don't imagine i'd want to use it long term i prefer the current look of the game it's part of why i haven't installed one of the many mods that change the look but i just don't see the point of changing the way minecraft looks ,0,Aug-19
0, scummy nvidia is probably pissed about everyone kind of knowing that they will announce it and won't release it now just for the heck of it i bet they were ready for release for computex but due to the pascal overstock they just didn't give us our new gpus ,0,Jul-18
0, the lineup goes like this the nvidia geforce gtx 10 series is great for 1080p the nvidia geforce rtx 20 series is great for 1440p and the nvidia geforce rtx 30 series will be great for 2160p 4k ,0,Jul-20
0, stock shortage manufacturers does not care just as retailers neither they sold their stock instantly it's a dream for them none of them cares about that real consumers have no access for those products gpus consoles they communicate this bs demand is so high now what is probably not bigger then before but it makes share holders happy that is what matters can't wait until it backfires to oems no one seem to care demand is not high it's just scalping but honestly who gets ripped off by scalpers they deserve it ,0,Nov-20
0, nvidia cards 50 bucks cheaper than the 6800xt yeah nah msrp yeah but here in newzealand the 3080 is starting from around 1550 which is 500 nzd over msrp while the 6800xt is around 1100 which after currency conversion is about msrp for the card most of the 3080s on the computer stores here are around the 1800 mark fucking insane makes the card completely useless while the 3070 is the same price as the 6800xt lol ,0,Nov-20
0, tip for anyone who just bought an rtx gigabyte card wait for the release of the super cards then return your card since it most likely has the 'pulsing fans' issue then either get the same tiered super card for extra performance or drop down a tier for likely similar performance and some extra ,0,Jun-19
0, question submitted to nvidia support ref 210418 003 feel free to copy and paste lodge you own support query to nvidia please explain to me specifically how nvidia's decision subsequent actions to restrict the performance of my rtx3060's likely future rtx gpu's ability to mine to its full potential and allow me to recoup my excessively high cost of purchase for any gpu at the moment is not in breach of australian us european consumer protection laws as an anti consumers rights competition breach i await your written formal response to insert relevant email address here so that i can lodge it along with my complaint to the australian competition and consumer commission plus forward it to my fellow concerned us european citizens ,0,Apr-21
0, crypto miners in reality don't have new gpus either other than a few i don't know more than the few that bought 1 3 at launch day in store ,0,Nov-20
0, in the uk we had 5mins when you could at least add it to your cart a whole step further than any amd nvidia card that has come out recently however buy the time you got into your cart the stock was gone ,0,Nov-20
0, important to anybody without an rtx and that wants his new minecraft look just us a shader pack they're less gpu dependant and can look even better than the official ray tracing ,0,Aug-19
0, called it told ya you guys fell for it i said nvidia did it right because the miners were going to buy up the 3060's if they didn't now amd's reached the same conclusion and though the miners bought up the cards anyway it's likely due to lack of alternative stock still even the announcement has slowed it down there is no legal basis to restrict sales to just gamers there's no constitutional protection and big red has walked back the previous promise i'm expecting the flood of new stock to delay them even more because they'll have even more options those who care about others and don't want to burn the time and money on mods are probably just going to buy the new cards and leave some gaming cards for other people even greedy mining farm owners don't want to go through life as the target of intense hate it's bad for business ,0,Mar-21
0, blame the people panic buying bitcoin and driving up prices that only gives more motivation for miners to get more graphics cards ,0,Dec-20
0, to get prices down boycott nvidia don't buy a new rtx right now then nvidia is forced to lower their insane prices ,0,Aug-18

0, should i buy a gtx 1660 super i have a gtx 1650 right now should i wait for this 3080 to release ,0,Jun-20
0, i hope that raytracing becomes a more common feature in games as graphics cards start to make it easier to run it looks really nice from the demos i've seen ,0,Aug-18
0, i mean just buy a 10th gen i7 and a 300 series rtx or equivalents for either i promise you'll be good for a long time and youll have more money for more important things like literally almost everything else in life ffs ,0,Jan-21
0, maybe i'm being too optimistic but if they can get gtx 2070 performance with a 299 price tag or even i'm sure they'll succeed massively a lot of people would switch ,0,Sep-18
0, gpu virtualization sweet i was looking for something like this i have a dream a dream of playing five instances of csgo on one beefy card instead of several okayish cards on lan parties with my friends ,0,Apr-21
0, nah nvidia's been misleading people with their laptop gpu naming for years now its not the pandemic they downclock and underpower the chips to keep them low wattage which would be ok if they didn't pretend they're the same cards you get in a desktop pc ,0,Jan-21
0, rtx 3060ti launched at 300 usd but resellers sold them for 510 eur in germany im sure 300 usd ist 520 eur or maybe their calculators dont work well ,0,Nov-20
0, wait exactly which gpu's do they have a glut on is its a mix of gpu's more then likely and why aren't they just you know selling them to us its not like gamer demand has decreased put those gpu on boards and start selling them nvidia ,2,Jun-18

0, it looks like my graphics card i hope it's cheap enough to buy i just want to play my favorite game in more than 10fps ,0,Jan-21
0, been an nvidia customer for about a decade but for the very first time im seriously considering an amd gpu given the disaster launch with the lack of availability and the power issues if amd puts out a decent card with perf near the 3080 big if i might actually get it instead hopefully their stocks are a bit better at launch ,0,Sep-20
0, so buy a gtx 1080 for like 2 to 300 dollars from that noob who thinks they need a 2080 ti right now ,0,Oct-18
0, someone didn't check their research the card crashes can be fixed with a software update the cards clock speeds need to be reduced sadly because those cards used cheaper capacitors if your going to spend the money anyways get the higher end models or just do the research post launch ,0,Sep-20
0, i really wanna get a 3060 graphic card but i really dont know what time and which page since i wanna upgrade my current one ,0,Feb-21
0, this is why i always say if you can wit for a gpu then wait because for those who bought a 2080 super model you actually just got fucked again for price ,0,Nov-20
0, a heads up that the reported 16gb vram for the xbox is actually combined memory with 10gb dedicated to graphics and 6gb as system memory if you think about it that's not a whole lot since most sis ship computers with a minimum of 8gb system memory ,0,Mar-20
0, you know gainward the company that has been producing graphics cards since 1984 yeah that one it tells me a lot more about this channel ,0,Aug-20
0, well shit can i get a discount on a 1070 if nvidia is just overflowing with excess gpus im still stuck running a 950 which overclocked is still surprisingly good but come on who doesnt want a shiny new gpu ,0,Jun-18
0, if nvidia really did say that and i wouldn't be surprised if they did then that is pretty heinous ray tracing is here to stay and will get better with time but for right now without dlss it just murders your frame rate so i turn it off right now it is just a neat feature that you can turn on if you want but i would bet most people are playing with it off most of the time ,0,Dec-20
0, i wonder if this mining limiter will limit also different workload usage like video processing gpu phisics and fluid simulations rendering shader building e t c would be nice to see this test before and after new drivers ,5,Feb-21
0, rtx minecraft for gtx100 cards nvidia enabled rtx or rather just ray path tracing not dlss for pascal but obviously there's a performance drop i have a gtx1080 so it would be interesting to see if i can run minecraft at 60fps with ray tracing i checked the settings in the game but there's no option there so are some games not supporting rtx ray tracing on pascal what's going on ,0,Aug-19
0, this is the only reason why ppl get excited about amd gpu release it lets us all but cheaper nvidia cards i don't expect amd to ever beat nvidia but i do expect them to force their hand to be more competitive and as a consumer we all win unless you have amd lol jk ,0,Jun-19
0, was expecting it to be called the 1630 but 1010 has a nice ring to it though not better than gtx 55 ,0,Jan-21
0, depends on the price the 2060 is made on an older process node so it wouldn't be competing for silicon with the 30 series so from that standpoint it would be a good thing but it's a generation old and it's a low end part so while i would love to pick up a 12gb version of the 2060 for 200 or less while i wait on supply and pricing to come back to sane levels for a current gen card i wouldn't pay more than that anything with less than 12gb of vram is a hard no for me anything costing more than 100 is also a hard no unless it's a 90 class card ,0,Sep-21
0, wtf wait a minute this is stepping over basic consumer rights a lawsuit needs to be filed and taken to the supreme cout we need a right to stream bill just like a right to repair bill a game publisher cannot be allowed to dictate how we play the steam games that have already been purchased in our library valve and invida need to step up and man up streaming laws and rites need to be created blizzard can't have it both ways if you as a publisher sells a game on steam that should be part of the terms of service a consumer has the rite to stream their game on any streaming service wether thats invidia or steam or any other streaming company or even host your own streaming service on a server somewhere where your game is installed on congressmen need to get together and draft up a bill for us and submit it asap gitrdone ,21,Feb-20
0, i dont understand why people are upset that it only gets 30 50 fps with ray tracing on current cards cant run ray tracing at all anyone who expected ray tracing at the same fps they get with current gen cards was just delusional i'm waiting for actual reviews about how it runs current games without ray tracing before i make any knee jerk reactions ,0,Aug-18
0, we at the verrge already have one of these cards and i'm installing it in my next build stay tuned ,0,Jan-19

0, of course amd cuts the production of gpu they were most likely losing money on 5700x is close enough and much better value in price to performance they couldnt lower the price to compete with 2070 super on the other hand considering how few of them are out there maybe r7 will become a collectible curiosity item xd ,0,Jul-19
0, the meeting at amd headquarters went like this what does nvidia want us to not do 32gb ok let's do that ,460,May-21
0, can someone help me out should i wait for zen 3 and the new amd gpus or go for a 1600af with an 8gig rx580 now i have a 600 budget for my entire build ,0,May-20
0, i already said this in the reddit post but this nvidia move for sure will drive up the resale prices of the cards that are already non lhr its gonna be like a collectors edition ,0,Apr-21
0, thats good though amd mining gpus considering 95 still wants 5700 5700xt 5600xt and such because they are still better for mining for that 95 of miners ,0,Mar-21
0, nividia will just do this put a 1170 on 1080 or something like that and sell it to us like it is a brand new fancy gpu ,0,Jul-18
0, buy used pcs not gpus you can actually get some good stuff found one with a i5 100 something k and a rtx 3070 at around 1500bucks which is extremley cheap in my country ,0,Sep-21

0, shits on evga the one card that was held back from public sale to fix the issue and was transparent about the issue ,1,Sep-20
0, i hate crypto miners when i built my first vr rig gtx100 series were impossible to get and this year i paid a scalper for a 3080 gamers take it in the rear so hipsters can get rich trading moms power bill for bitcoins string em up ,0,Nov-20
0, it's ridiculous since miners will buy any gpu they find anyway whether for gaming or mining the bad thing about having gpu for mining is that later we will not be able to buy it second hand for gaming ,0,Mar-21
0, this will help the gpu shortage all the people that bought a ton of gpus will now have to sell them and to compete and get their money back they will sell them cheaper than scalpers which will then make scalpers lower their price which will then make miners lower the prices and lather rinse then repeat ,3,Feb-21
0, id love to get an rtx 2080 ti this would be my first founders edition and it would be the first giveaway id actually win xd ,0,Sep-18
0, mining cards are a dumb idea and even if they do release them miners will still prefer the gaming cards why because as mining gets harder the current gpus lose profitability very quickly so in 1 2 years miners will want to sell their cards to recoup costs and who would buy them that's right gamers you cannot sell a mining gpu to gamers it's going straight to the trash ,0,Feb-21
0, i have a gtx 980 ti i am gonna upgrade to gt1010 because it is a higher number d just kidding ,2,Apr-21
0, i already wasn't going to by the new gpus only because of money i feel so bad for all the people who were looking forward to this only to be scammed out of it but man thank you for the good guy with the bot jamming up all the over priced scalpers on ebay we salute you ,0,Sep-20
0, its not that the one dealer had to send back the gpu's because they had too many its because those shippments were not meant for them and were to be returned because the demand on them is still too damn high its still just as difficult to get shipments of gpus and they are just taking forever to make the next gpu generation because they know their cards are still in high demand so that way they can jack up the prices and make even more money than they should be getting ,0,Jun-18
0, they should release compute only only units that can be used for mining and ai applications etc with a gaming addon board perhaps they could squeeze each into a singe slot maybe by removing a fairly weedy fan and upgrading to something decent this would mean nvidia could get a mass load of mining gpus out the door really quickly and when the minings have made back their coi they could sell them to gamers who could through on a 100 50 addon and get a kick ass gaming gpu for cheapies ,0,Feb-21
0, heck yeah ive wanted this for such a long time and so i might upgrade from a radeon vii once i get both of these gpus ,0,Nov-20
0, this doesn't make sense really are you that near sighted here's a reason for you buddy nvidia are very unlikely to ever release any more new gtx cards after this year as rtx is their new baby the 21xx series will completely replace all budget cards and 2xx is for rtx so 1660 fills the gap nicely between 1060 and 2060 this is probably to deter people from expecting and winging for new gtx cards as well ,0,Feb-19
0, soon graphics card will come with pci express slot to put another graphics card in them and that one will also have its own pci slot ,0,Oct-20
0, its also been leaked that nvidia intentionally induced forced scarcity to up prices of their gpus but it backfired with a bunch of negative pr ,1,Sep-20
0, 300k of gpus waiting to be sold yet prices are still absurd hold my fellow pc comrades their defenses are growing weak soon we shall be tasting the fruits of our patience in 300 bucks 1080ti being the norm keep holding we are almost there ,55,Jun-18
0, i have no hope for the 2060 re release i bought a 2060 in november 2020 for aud 450 the same gpu is now selling for aud 950 the gpu market is ridiculous with no end in sight ,2,Sep-21
0, that's it i'm not buying any rtx2080 or 2090s this year oh wait i can't anyway i've not got enough money to pay the scalpers ,0,Dec-20
0, i'm beginning to think the mobile rtx 300 series card will be out before i can even get a 3080 for my pc ,0,Nov-20
0, i highly recommend everyone educate themselves on nvidia's terrible anti consumer anti competitive practices i'm sure the hype train will come a chugging along and nvydia will make a ton of money as they always do but i will vote with my wallet and not buy nvidia cards luckily my rx480 is serving me great and i hope that amd can get back to a competitive point with nvidia ,0,Aug-18
0, i think it's absolutely hilarious that invidia gives a shit who is buying their cards if i was selling a product and it was being bought faster than i could make them i would not care one iota ,0,Apr-21
0, it appears nvidia is somewhat lacking in the morals department its a slap across the face for anyone who recently bought a 3090 thinking they bought the flagship ,0,Aug-21
0, who need gpu i would gladly give you a piece of my gtx 5200 is better than 3080ti because the number is higher ,0,Apr-21
0, is that why amd graphic cards are taking so long they are busy trying to think of the stupidest names to call them ,0,Sep-20
0, honestly at this point who can even affort these cards they keep getting more expensive even my rtx 2060s hurt my wallet really bad only to see that a 2080ti is performing nearly twice as good for a ridiculous price of course games keep up with these new developments using more and more detailed graphics so you are basically forced to upgrade every now and then what a vicious circle lol ,1,Jun-20
0, when rdna2 is making about to start nvidia 300 series is not exist so if rdna2 is not destroyed 300 series dont critisize amd when rdna 2 is making that time 2080ti is in the market so rdna2 is killer 2080ti amd win ,0,Sep-20
0, alternate title nvidia has self esteem issues alternate title to the alternate title nvidia joins the dark side alternate title to the alternate of the alternate title nvidia proves to everyone that they watched the godfather alternate title to the alt oh hell you get the point by now nvidia does nvidia things no one is surprised ,0,Dec-20
0, how the hell did not the power temp limiters stop the gpus from being grilled its a basic part of the gpu ,1,Jul-21
0, amd gave up all that's happened is that they are not using manufacturing hbm2 anymore and these cards use that type of ram hence why they are discontinuing them ,0,Jul-19
0, nvidia crippling mining on gpus will do fucking nothing to improve supply small time miners are not a issue it's the billion dollar mining funds when the bubble crashes the used market won't get flooded with cheap 300 series either god bless the people at nvidia cuz they know how to squeeze more money outta people and make it seem like a good thing ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia had a press release revealing where the capacitors may contribute to the cause it has more to do with the firmware ,0,Sep-20
0, this is what you paying when you are buying gpus that's why prices are inflated and on top of that they sell you out dated broken down garbage ,0,Apr-20
0, the wierder thing that now graphics card are not used for graphical at all why not changing the name to mining card instead lol meh in the past centuries you can get a performance graphics card for just 250 in now days we are fightning against scalpers ai deep learners bitcoin miners cloud gaming servers are you wish this situations gonna let the price down lol gtx 1080ti is still expensive in 2021 i wanna buy gtx 1660 super but now there is no stock available in my country ,1,Feb-21
0, amd is not taking the high end i know you want that to be the case soo bad but the 3090 is going to be the best card out there for gaming still ,0,Nov-20

0, wow nvidia re enabling passtrough officially still kinda hard to believe it wonder what models they will allow to do it anyways ,0,Mar-21
0, does anyone remember when nvidia bought voodoo card maker 3dfx and then promptly dissembled the company and took its competitor cards off the shelves no me neither they would never do that again right ,0,Feb-21
0, radeon vii is dead sure it's more for content creation but amd's marketing was off an average consumer would think this is a gaming card also the 5700 xt was just a bit slower than the vii so effectively replacing it at a cheaper price ,0,Jul-19
0, commpetion is great for the cunsomer nvidia was fat all these years and now amd are at the same level or better ,0,Jul-19
0, at the risk of looking like a fanboy but i would be pretty upset too if i made something and they were not representing my product fairly rtx is the main reason you would buy an nvidia gpu and if you don't care about rtx that much radeon 600 series is clearly the way to go ,0,Dec-20

0, other than slow the rate at which security holes are patched what does keeping hardware drivers closed source actually accomplish it's not like i can go out and download a gpu i'd still have to buy the hardware which is where they make ze money is it anything other than shitheadedness by force of habit ,0,Mar-20

0, so anthony said theres no reason to go nvidia as a gamer but he also said that amd has no answer to the 2080 super and presumably the 2080ti so if i want a high end card shouldnt i go nvidia ,0,Jul-19
0, im so pissed at nvidia when i found out i could get a 499 graphics card with amazing performance and graphics i was so excited then when it comes out they release like ten cards and sell them all to bots yes the amd cards still stand but they also got sold out in less than a minute then they pull this stuff with hardware unboxed which is nvidias entitled way of saying if you have a different opinion than me then you get screwed im honestly so done with nvidia switching to amd forever at least they actually plan to have supply within less than a year ,0,Dec-20

0, what is worse about the 3090 super is that if so it's a literal 5 boost for a crazy amount of inefficiency my 3090 heats up like a motherfuxker no way would i want more heat i'm trying to watercool it asap i don't want to live in a 90c room include portable room ac with purchase or something lmfao at least we can get that early until someone can buy any gpu at all ,0,Aug-21

0, my 980ti is still going strong and handles everything i've thrown at it with ease i see no real reason to replace it yet nvidia can blow themselves as far as i'm concerned jacking up the price just because they can doesn't sit right with me and i really hope amd spank them hard with their new cards ,0,Jun-18
0, i might go back to jail breaking if they could keep other apps from detecting the jailbreak i have an app i need to manage an hsa card that wont open because i kail broke a while back even though ive updated since then and its not jailbroken anymore ,0,May-20
0, why are we only getting 12gb of vram what is this early 2015 we're paying 200 more than the titan x to get the same 12gb capacity of vram sure gddr6 is reletively new being less than a year old for the 3080ti where as gddr5 was somthing like 6 or 7 years old for the titan x but come on this card is 6 years older than the 3080ti and you're going to charge us more for the same ammount of ram not to mention we're not getting the full 100 class die and not getting the titan quadro drivers the disturbing part is that if you want the equivalent 100 class ampere die to the maxwell die that was in the titan x 99 you're going to have to shell out 10 400 for an nvidia ampere a100 and even that is a cut down card because it doesnt have video out like the titan did ,0,May-21
0, 300k too many gpus considering what was goin' down this time last year that's both kind of hilarious but also really sad since many customers had to pay wicked much over launch price to just get a single one while miners snatched up boatloads that're now hitting the used resale markets as close to scrap gpus 'cuz they've been runnin' nonstop at high temps for long periods at a time with hardly any caring for their condition f maybe if nvidia decides to compensate buyers of mining worn cards for people buying second hand junk by swapping the first 300k for a free new one it'd win them some popularity back ,0,Jun-18
0, i would not be surprised if rtx 300 on laptops is only slightly faster than rtx 200 because ampere has almost the same efficiency as turing the 3080 3090 are only faster because they suck more power but more tdp is not possible in laptops ,1,Oct-20

0, about not actually owning your hardware argument geforce lineup is specifically meant to be used for gaming if you're using it for mining you're essentially using it not according to it's use purpose yes these cards are fundamentally cappable of crypto mining so nvidia never said they can be used for it or supported such use case it's not nvidia who's causing problems it's you miners ,0,Feb-21
0, woohoo a 2080 which is the same as the 1080 but now with a huge amount of gigarays they can't do much but they sure have a lot of gigarays gigarays gigarays and more gigarays i'll just say gigarays one more time this sums up the event from nvidia yesterday a shit load of gigarays but no mention of actual performance increase in terms of fps so that won't be much ,0,Aug-18

0, nvidia can eat my fat butt some people like me will occasionally game and primarily use gpus for 3d rendering and sometimes mine to help pay for the gpu putting a mining limiter on gpus will do nothing to solve shortages but it will make nvidia less appealing to people like me who use their gpus for everything ,0,Apr-21
0, i'm kinda happy gpu shortage happened because with no game drawing my attention i don't see a need to upgrade or even get a costly computer that barely does better then this current one once this computer goes i'm out of the race to get a computer the cost is just to much now ,0,Apr-21

0, idk about nvidia if the cooler itself could cost around 150 its just not worth it imo but ive no experience with any of the newer cards ,0,Jun-20
0, my hand just reached to stock app to buy amd until i heard there is no raytracing and nvidia is dropping prices i'm confused is it going up or down tomorrow ,0,Jun-19
0, gtx is still going to be around for the lower end cards so is not going anywhere unless everyone buys rtx cards which they won't then rt will just be another hairworks that everyone ignores ,0,Aug-18
0, speaking of bots i took a gander at ebay just to see how much 3k series cards were being listed at boy was i surprised to see that there are a ton of people willing to part with 2x more expensive cards all cards are being bid on from what i can see question is are they real people hehe ,0,Nov-20

0, what if graphics are processed locally and some other stuff then thats like most of it whats the point then ,0,Jul-18
0, everyone is talking about these horrible roll outs lets face it they are trying to get rid of their obsolete stock and are not going to make it cheap or easy to get next gen gpus until the nvidia 200 series and amd 500 series stocks are depleted ,0,Dec-20
0, omg for the price of that monitor you can buy a 4k 144hz 1 ms monitor and with 35 inches and it is a lot better not worth the money i think and hopefully amd is going to announce the new graphics cards at e3 d ,0,May-19
0, the release of the 3080ti is just nvidia pushing the fact that they don't care about gamers disappointing i'm just here waiting patiently with my gtx1070 while everyone i know still uses 1050s 1060s etc ,0,May-21

0, 1440p up to 120fps i would like to know witch games get that frame rate anyways is good proposition for a game pass machine hope you can save game install files in a external hard drive because that expansion card yiakes ,0,Sep-20
0, whoa whoa whoa i detect a rounding error the 3060 ti in a broad range of games is 21 faster than the 5700xt in rasterization at 1440p high ultra and 28 faster at 4k source hardware unboxed 3060 ti review conclusion section at which resolution its 8 gb frame buffer is ill suited in my opinion since the 5700xt does not support ray tracing rasterization comparisons are those where percentages matter and there is no metric representing an objective average by which the 5700xt is 30 slower than the 3060 ti the inverse of 21 faster is 17 18 slower not 30 at 1440p the inverse of 28 faster is 21 22 slower not 30 at 4k should the actual price of a 5700xt you can buy undercut the price of a 3060 ti by more than 100 or so their cost per frame is equivalent or favorable to the older radeon gpu if on the other hand you could get a decently built 3060 ti for around 400 that would be an expected generational price to performance improvement versus the 5700 xt and no better than expected for a card released 16 months later as the market stands today however i insist that your stoked tone has no place in speaking about the rtx 3060 ti ,0,Nov-20
0, what happened to the whole ray tracing is enabled for certain 10 series cards even though its not nearly as good as on the 20 series thing ,0,Aug-19

0, wait some people were still hoping to get one i mean where were they in the rest of 2020 ' i'm not even bothering with it whether is a gpu or the ps5 i'll wait at least until next summer maybe by then i'll just have to pop in a store and grab one easily maybe ,0,Nov-20

0, 2060 with more vram is just nvidia way to sell another card at 300 ofc its going to cost 700 800 cuz screw miners and scalper ,1,Sep-21
0, why polaris gen 3 why not a depowered vega or navi after a few months polaris sucked on apu and also upon the gpu end why amd is still clinging on to what's lost a long time ago with a refreshed 12 mm node structure ,0,Oct-18

0, still won't buy rtx because they don't deserve our business due to their bs anti consumer practices navi's initial pricing is too high also unfortunately specifically so they can get rid of the rest of the old stock but when navi prices come down or a bigger better navi is released i will buy navi which looks incredible amd all the way ,0,Jun-19

0, gamers nexus posted a video talking about manufacturer's comments in regards to the rtx 3060 ti seems that the msrp is not realistic so will see what happens if shortcuts are taken or they up the price compared to what the msrp should be ,0,Nov-20
0, i just realized that earlier when he tested the best graphical settings on the best card he got the same frame rate as the ps4 is getting but like at least its good graphics ,2,Dec-20
0, there are plenty of rtx 30 series available here in thailand i can just walk in the shopping mall and pick one up ,0,Nov-20
0, this tells me this hardware unboxed reviews are more trustworthy than other reviewers they do not fall to nvidias pressure and thus remain closer to the truth but i do wonder reviewers who aren't in trouble with nvidia are nvidia shills food for thought right there ,0,Dec-20
0, in other areas we are seeing floating point formats with short mantissas for doing ai i wonder if gpus will start sprouting special hardware for the purpose it seems a natural ,0,Nov-19
0, i think itll probably be a black gpu using chroma black fans but theyll do a limited edition noctua brown version ,0,Aug-21
0, no you just buy a used nvidia card for the price of a new 2060super you can probably get a used 1080ti ,0,Jul-19
0, amd and nvidia made a deal to milk the public as much as they can thats what you get with 2 company system if everyone on the planet ignored them until october i bet you million dollars we would see a 2080 and rad 7 for 300 dollars ,0,Feb-19
0, as i cant get any of these cards and the available 3080 are not 699 but 899 i kinda feel fuck you nvidia and i will buy the next amd ones instead as they built the hardware for the consoles anyway i know which games will run good ,0,Oct-20
0, first i love you guys second don't joke about getting paid my nvidia i know you don't but you're going to make the conspiracy theorists horny so to speak ,0,Jul-19
0, me buys rtx2060 oc nvidia lets release rtx cards that have more power and the old cards at a cheaper price point ,5,Jun-19
0, a card with 150 the performance of the xbox series x and double the price probably but less vram fuck you nvidia sincerely the customers ,0,Aug-20
0, i'm fine with this it means the price of gaming gpus might return to a sane level since they will no longer be hoarded by chinese bitcoin miners ,3,Feb-21
0, for the people getting excited about the excess gpus those might be destroyed to mantain the supply demand stable so don't hold your breath ,0,Jun-18
0, of course there's going to be new cards i just bought a new one on prime day you all can thank me later alwayshappens ,19,Jul-18
0, i sort of don't want the 11 20 series to come out in a way because it would make me feel less cool about my gtx 1080 i am not interested in upgrading already but i don't want to feel left behind ,1,Jul-18
0, mining absolutely needs to be stomped even if its not a gpu shortage issue its a ridiculous environmental issue that shouldnt exist ,0,Feb-21
0, good clickbait title but yeah the radeon vii was a doa product for amd especially because they didn't for allow custom cooler cards why it's no competition for the faster cooler more quiet custom rtx 2080s outthere at the same 700 dollar euro pricepoint and now nvidia will be coming out with a even better rtx 2080 super for the same price i'm not surprised amd gave up on the radeon vii ,2,Jul-19
0, so basically my gtx 1080 is still going to be relevant for next 5 years or so simply because of nvidias incompetence of creating true next gen cards sweet ,0,Feb-19
0, you gotta remember that aus prices include gst tax so it may sound more expensive than what gpus are normally advertised at in us ,11,Sep-21
0, a card you can actually buy yeah right i sat on nvidias site refreshing and clicked the button for the the founders edition the second it was released but they were sold out before the store page could load i at least manged to add the 3070 to my cart when that released but it sold out before i could complete the purchase due to the store erroring out 10 times ,0,Nov-20
0, i get that its an enthusiast thing half the time but as an owner of the 1080ti fe why would you ever need something stronger than that to game or browse as of right now the card does not seem that beneficial to the average consumer youd be better of getting a lesser card for a better value lets see them benchmarks ,0,Aug-18
0, people need to understand that even if the restrictions on the upcoming rtx 3600 cards were somehow relaxed it still doesn't mean miners will prefer it to others the nvidea cmp cards have much better hash rates and their performance hash watt power consumption is far better than gpus because there is always so much demand for nvidea gpu cards there is not the same markup on the cmp cards making them an even more attractive alternative people need to understand that just because someone mined 7 per day on a rtx 3600 doesn't mean miners wouldn't buy a comparable priced cmp card that mines 10 dollars at a portion of the power consumption alot of people talking about the market for these cards without knowing much about anything at all ,0,Feb-21
0, credit card frauds that's why you stay home and not go to work so you don't have to own a car or go to the gas station since you don't have a job you don't have a credit card that works so nobody can steal your money voila simple trick try it ,0,Dec-19
0, how is the rx 6600 amd loving us its just a worse 6600 xt which even then was a bad value compared to the 3060 ti no company loves anyone they are here to make money and in this market nvidia and amd could care less about the average joe as they are making bank form crypto ,0,Sep-21
0, wanted the 3070 on the 15th but to be realistic that wasnt happening unless i bought it for 30k from a scalper so yeah doesnt really matter also delayed or not still going to see a scalper issue with it so ig mid next year you can get your 30 series card at the retail price ,0,Sep-20
0, coders have found a hack to enable virtualization on geforce gpu's yes the hack is installing the newest drivers that literally says it's enabled now and it's not about alowing multiple users on one gpu it's allowing multiple gpu's in one system with passthrough to run in virtual machines ,14,Apr-21
0, hahah ahahah nvidia super screwing up all the shitty rtx fanboys that buy the 1200 card 800 bucks for the super that would piss me off so hard but typically nvidia ,0,Jun-19
0, i am leaving nvidia because there's no freesync and i'm too poor for gsync that apu idea is cool but not for enthusiasts so thanks but ill pass lol ,0,Aug-18
0, we are more worried about bezos having our hand print with our credit card details and not much about the hygiene ,0,Sep-20
0, nvidia needs to make sure that the card will throttle when put to mining tasks so it isn't just a software garbage collection that they're making the card do and completely turn the fans off when a counterfeit driver is put in place an awesome issue for 3090s ,1,Aug-21
0, you know the answer guys any crypto you use stop using dump the value and the cards are then going to be second hand and relatively worthless ,0,Nov-20
0, i can tell you there are a lot of people who will refuse to buy noctua cards because of the color like its great and all that that's your national color but its really f kng ugly to most people ,1,Aug-21
0, yeah fuck i just bought a rtx 2060 and now a better one is comming for the same price fuck ,0,Jun-19
0, crypto is why i have a 1060 instead of 1070 i blame nvidia seems jensen doesn't want my money again i doubt they'll want to compete with amd on bang for buck ,0,Nov-20
0, no nvidia announced their intention to buy arm for 40b and the various boards of directors agreed that doesn't mean the deal will get past regulators in all the involved countries it's going to be at least a year before we know whether or not the deal can actually happen ,0,Sep-20
0, why talk about something you know jack shit about minecraft raytracing works with amd as well its not unique to rtx ,0,Aug-19
0, stuck with gpu's highly doubt it prices are not back to normal in na and their own website and evga still have limits on purchases ,0,Jun-18
0, not really hyped for new gpus next gen consoles seem to be capable of 4k60fps without the hassle of dealing with shite like windows and cheaters pc already ruined fall guys just a bunch of sad no life nobodies on pc and i say that as a pc gamer prolly retire soon from it unless they announce a 20tflop gpu at like 400 ,0,Aug-20
0, jensen be like hype hype look at our new rtx 3080 and 3090 amd be like watch this i am about to ruin this man s career ,0,Oct-20
0, 1 for me to get an rtx card the performance is gonna have to be at the very least 50 above my 1080ti and they are going to have to have 100 less ugly coolers 2 i hope ajit pia gets cancer ,0,Jun-19
0, well amd just drop the price of the 5700 fx so i still have a reason to try out an amd gpu before 2020 ,0,Jun-19
0, if they dont call it the gtx 2060 or gtx 2050 then they have missed the change to just have those letters differentiate ray tracing and non ray racing cards ,0,Jan-19
0, there will only be 500 cards because they'll need a separate power plant for the radeon vii gpu's power hunger ,0,Jan-19
0, i hope really hope getting a 3070 will be possible but the only thing they have done is delay the cards they aren't adding like human interactiong to the buying possess or adding any kind of captchas or even a limite to how many people can buy so i think all this delay will do is have the bots buy them all out within 7 min instead of 3 min ,0,Oct-20
0, the ram goes up but how about the 3d render it dose it tiered i buy latest card and ram on gpu is around 40 used and 3d render is spazig out ,0,Jun-18
0, miners wont buy mining specific chips if graphics cards are available surely they can resell a normal graphics card 3 years later for like 70 80 value once it stops being competitive profitable compared to buying new ones because it's still worth it for games and mid range video work while a mining specific card once it's not profitable to mine on i can't see anyone buying the pre owned i can see this helping the miners have more stock but i can't see it help consumers users get hold of the normal cards any easier the approach of trying to make the gaming cards not run the miner stuff seems like it'll do more ,0,Mar-21
0, if the vram is one of the most expensive thing in a graphics card and they re release a cheaper gpu with more vram it won't be that cheap anymore anyway do we need 12gb on 2060 ,0,Sep-21
0, so basically they're confusing people even more by having the rtx 2080ti followed by the rtx 2080 super rtx 2070 super etc ,0,Jun-19
0, yeah i was considering between 3070 and 6800 xt buy for 2021 when availability improves and so far i've been using nvidia cards for years still running 1070 ti but this has changed my mind i'm not willing to buy from such a toxic company done with them ,0,Dec-20
0, this video as most is bullshit if amd would compete in a huge number of titles the vega 56 gives the 1080 a black eye and that is not the top tier card from amd but you don't mention that because you don't have one you go by test reviewers using that trash reference card get a clue nvidia uses binned chip for reference cards and charges a premium for them they are best case amd throws out the run of the mill reference card and aib's make them shine has been that way for a decade looking at steam hardware survey most of you run a 1060 or similar card why would amd build a 2080ti style card for your broke arse you won't buy it anyway after buying my vega 56 pulse i was informed there is a vega club that is how few people buy or can afford that level of gaming nvidia and miners are dumping pascal at lower then msrp and the rtx series is priced so you don't buy it wake up edit to all you nvidia fanboys take your 1080 ti and do some gaming take lots of screen shots install a rx 470 480 570 580 56 64 and play the same game and take screen shots compare the shots from both cards nvidia is fast but their graphics suck you are paying high dollar for mcdonald's and they want to ray trace that trash ,0,Oct-18
0, if you can't buy a graphics card then neither an apu with your friendly local scalper getting all of them ,1,May-21
0, to be honest i feel amd is a bit behind in terms of gpus if amd released vega 64 earlier and the radeon vii when the 1080ti was still king there would be a huge shake up unfortunately its not so lets hope amd ups their game even more next gen ,0,Jan-19
0, i'm still rockin a 1070 from msi that i bought in 2017 and i'm here wondering if i should upgrade i don't feel like its needed seeing that with current games i have never had any problems and rtx is cool but not necessary what are your thoughts ,0,Aug-20
0, nvidia doesn't deserve arm their artificial software based hardware segmentation is unwelcomed in arm imagine buying a raspberry pi 4b for 55 or 599 for the one with software support lol don't believe me jetson nano vs jetson xavier anyone same as quadro vs rtx gtx ,0,Apr-21
0, i'm tired of companies telling users how they can use their products and limiting hardware features in software particularly nviida between sr iov vgpu and now this stupid mining limiter i'm getting rather frustrated just let us do with our products what we want this is the same kind of crap cisco does with their unlockable features too on many of their professional devices especially their video conferencing systems mining is a great way to subsidize the purchase of an expensive gpu heck if the crypto market stays reasonably stable my 3090 should have itself and the power it took to mine paid off in about a year and a half which is pretty freaking fantastic especially in this day and age of 1700 video card msrps ,1,Apr-21
0, funny story i actually had to buy a gt710 recently for an old computer that wouldn't run photoshop anymore due to lack of features on a third gen i5 onboard graphics and yet it wouldn't need extra cooling or a new psu there is a market for these things if only they wouldn't be so expensive relative to how bad they are ,0,Jan-21
0, at this rate i'll probably get an nvidia rtx 3080 graphics card in 2022 just in time to upgrade my computer ,0,Dec-20
0, the feels are real my gpu is dying and to buy a new one i might as well buy a whole new pc sadge ,0,May-21
0, i'm gonna laugh my ass of when people buy the 3090 soon as amd launch big navi nvidia counters it with 3090ti ,0,Aug-20
0, its ok in 2021 eth is coming and there will be no more eth mining so all those people buying up gpu's for mining it will soon be selling it at a great discount ,0,Dec-20
0, unsurprising to hear but then again in 2019 there should be absolutely no reason not to have a security chip in your cards if that's the case the cc company should be as liable as the gas station operators ,2,Dec-19
0, so for the rtx does it mean i should regret just buying a gtx 1070 i dont think so but i want to know for sure ,0,Aug-18
0, you know what i hate about the gpu market not so upgradeable parts whats this my midrange gpu need more memory my low end gpu need more bang tough luck you need to buy the whole thing including its own motherboard and new heat cooling really and i have no idea why is this ,0,Dec-20
0, so you spent 1300 on a graphics card to play minecraft a failure on so many levels i will let you in on a secret minecraft always looked like that you just have to use your imagination ,0,Aug-19
0, oh no snap has higher quality than shield and sword so much for couldnt do high graphics 3d animated pokemon of all gens oh and omegas on go but not on shield and sword so not limiting the gen but spreading the profiteering by forcing those that miss there pokemon to purchase multiple games to have there chance to have all there favorites i think amiibo went to there head they like the profit and discrimination and inequality oh superior in gaming nintendo where you go you were the resident evil star wars marvel dc and disney first fighter games great dungeon crawlers and you where the platformer and innovative console olympic mat duck hunt laser lightgun gaming glove i miss nes snes and n64 you had movie games cartoon games and comic games where you go nintendo nintendo had the game cheats button combos and game tricks i miss classic nintendo ,0,Jun-20
0, nvidia fools us all how can one assume they just havent seen it coming that people simply start to money differnt than ethereum they are not stupid nvidia is like your crush who fucks you up all the time but you can't let go cause she's too nicee d ,0,Jun-21
0, spain's april 1st in a report in south korea that appeared to be in english not sketchy at all nothing to see here rtx 30s haha what are those move along ,8,Dec-20
0, we all have to agree that the radeon vii was a massive mistake they should've launched navi on january instead ,0,Jul-19
0, i just realized that amd is trying to ride the good value thermal perf winds of its rx 570 into the navi post gcn era and not trying to ape nvidia's 300 series marketing numbers ,0,May-19
0, thats like saying a semi truck is the biggest automobile im pretty sure this thing doesnt fit in a pcie slot so calling it a graphics card is a stretch ,0,May-20
0, 175 00 00 worth of rtx 3080s 699 using the 3080 since it's the middle gpu in the 30 series lineup is 250 00 gpus that's far more than the consumer market has seen so using nvidia's last quarterly gpu sales as a benchmark doesn't make any sense because a vast majority of those earnings were 20 series ,2,Nov-20
0, my dad a civil engineer has to use windows 7 because the driver for a tablet he uses doesnt work on windows ten and now i guess hes losing graphics driver updates too ,1,Jun-21
0, if nvidia can actually get miners to guy cmps instead of geforce cards then it would mean actual geforce cards being in stock anywhere ,1,Feb-21
0, hahaha if a game could brick any hardware in your computer the world would be in serious trouble even not limiting your fps should never ever in a million years destroy your gpu if it is not adequately cooled it will simply throttle and that is it the only way this is real is if nvidia mucked something up in the drivers ,0,Jul-21
0, alex rocks cue cards are your friend and just go with the flow make any arbitrary comments you want and make editing fix the final product ,0,Jun-18
0, world you couldn't possibly screw up this launch any worse nvidia well ctd there is that on a positive note we just wanted to be tops in that category too ,0,Oct-20
0, well heres hoping the 300 series takes the price of the 200 series and what happened when we were transitioning from 10 to 20 occurrs the last of the 10 series is officially sold at a lower price slowly shifting to the 20 series with the new card becoming the staple product at a set price depending on performance im either gonna stick with my 1080 ti like i did when 2080 came out or make the swap and not only make my wallet cry but make myself cry ,0,Jun-20
0, easy choice to go amd for future graphics card now about the same performance use less power and the company doesnt seem to be run by arseholes ,0,Dec-20
0, anyone wonder why sli support quietly ended last year and now graphics cards are the most expensive they've ever been i was thinking to myself a solution to this problem is using more then one cheap video card but guess what ,0,Apr-21

0, as a pc gamer i was skeptical about the one x being 4k 60fps for such a cheap price i ended up buying one and it does deliver what it claims it may not be as good as ultra graphics at 4k 60fps but it definitely is 60fps at 4k and it's really good ,0,Jun-19
0, the 3090 is a twin gpu card the cooler with the opposing fans is a 3090 only cooler for that twin gpu card that is why youll notice there is no sli socket on the leaked 3080 cards ,0,Jun-20
0, the only problem with big navi is still the drivers i had to return a 5700 xt because of so many issues i bought a gtx 2060s and everything is working perfectly i wish amd took better care of their drivers because i would love to buy one ,0,Oct-20
0, nvidias plan isnt working orly it never planned to be working otherwise mining would be blocked in gpu bios and using e fuses in gpus themselves ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia is using bitcoins again as excuse believe me miner to non miners nvidia graphics card are bad value to mining reason they are very power hungry current rtx series is just worst value however rx 5500x or rx5600x are really great value if you are looking for it ,0,Dec-20
0, nvidia is manipulating the market as soon as demand is bellow stock thet sell of stock directly to miners to keep stock bellow demand to keep the prices high i'm short don't buy nvidia cards ever ,0,Nov-20
0, why do these companies hate the miners so much the real culprits of the severe gpu shortage is the scalpers not the miners no miner is going to buy a video card if it is not going to be able to pay itself off the worst thing is a lot of gamers support the restriction of gaming cards the new 'mining' cards are very unimpressive and i doubt any miner would even consider buying a cmg card or whatever they called them ,0,Mar-21
0, lets get one thing clear ethereum is the most lucrative crypto to mine if this blocker becomes mainstream among nvidia gpus and all of them start mining alternatives the returns will come crashing down as right now only a small minority actually mines other coins as soon as that number grows the returns will decrease ,0,Feb-21
0, good luck installing call of duty modern warfare 250 gb lol into any video card anytime soon maybe in 2050 ,1,Oct-20
0, im impressed at how the radeon software autodetected and autoenabled freesync on my rx5700xt pc i refuse to overpay for nvidia sync so my gtx 1080 system will learn to use freesync or do without ,0,Dec-20
0, if nvidia wants to go through with the acquisition it should disguise itself as a refugee grape gang and it would get full support and immunity from the british parliament but if it accidentally slips up and reveals itself to be a white person telling a slightly off colored joke it'll have to deal with all of scotland yard ,0,Apr-21
0, they also make a mistake with the 3090 serie there are a lot still available in stocks in europe shops and no one is buying it since it cost way too much compared to the performance but they used the same gddr6x and gpu that could have been inside a 3080 ,0,Nov-20

0, amd pleas please make a gpu or a new feature to the new rdna 2 cards that boosts performance in programs like blender maya and c4d nvidia already does this but their cards are weaker in gaming ,1,Nov-20
0, never claim something cannot be hacked that starts a chain of events and a countdown sort of a competition between hacking groups never challenge your enemy to test your defenses nvidia wtf there are countless genius coders sitting at home not working in the industry because they don't want to or lack the ambition to but this is the sort of thing that motivates that type and they haven't been boxed into a corporate cubicle for years and tend to think outside that cube they'll hit your code from directions you couldn't have imagined i give it 2 days literally 2 days after release for this to be bypassed the money coming from giant mining farms will break this laughably fast ,0,Feb-21
0, i think nvidia will turn out like tesla theyll take a long time to deliver but when they do theyll blow everyone away ,3,Jun-18
0, lol i can't wait for nvidia to succeed fuck miners and scalpers and honestly this is great because its going to financial screw over the scalpers because there will be no gamer buying the scalped cards which means miners will have to shell out more for the mineable cards shifting the the favor completely over to gamers yes ,0,Apr-21
0, guess ill wait until i graduate from college get a job a wife a child wait for that kid to get to first grade then i can buy a graphics card because thatll be when the shortage ends ,0,Sep-21

0, wow talk about the mother of all elephants in the room at the show today he talked about everything but the actual fps gpu performance increase in games not a good sign the fact actual performance was completely omitted from today's presentation is not a good sign ,0,Aug-18
0, i swear minecraft rtx was already available as a mod whats the difference is it like the quake 2 rtx ,0,Aug-19
0, pc owners please nvidia my gpu is going ancient and i managed to save just about enough for the new 3060 card but scalpers got them all because of your easy to be abused by bots store please do something about it nvidia we got you fam also nvidia ,0,Feb-21

0, the bricked cards are in no way the fault of new world no fps limit might be stupid but if a userspace software can brick the hardware of a gpu that is 100 the fault of nvidia manufacturers especially when the software just makes the card what it is supposed to do which is render stuff fast ,0,Jul-21
0, was anyone actually expecting rtx 4 to launch this year the 3 is still basically a paper launch 7 months on and without shortages its always been 2 years between series possibly a 4080 in september 2022 but due to shortages im sure they will still be filling back orders of 3 by then so maybe 4 in march 2023 seems reasonable ,0,Apr-21
0, between a 3070 and 3080 fucking lame i was hoping is was going to be like a 970 or 570 and for actually like 100 to 150 bucks we dont need anymore high end gpus ,0,Apr-21
0, that was really petty of nvidia to do that very unprofessional but on the other hand i'm not gonna lie rtx performance is very important my current 1080 in my desktop handles games at 1440p just fine but i want higher res and real time ray tracing both of which you need an rtx card for to use dlss and ray tracing together for people who's eyes are closed ray tracing wasn't on every game before because it only available on the latest gen nvidia gpus now it's available on 2 gens of nvidia and the latest gen amd gpu's and also on new consoles so many more games will support it and since it's such a taxing graphic option performance matters ,0,Dec-20
0, don't care about amd in cars i'll never be able to afford and i don't care about nvidia releasing lower end product that's what the used market is for i'm waiting for nvidia and amd to release significantly higher end product than the 3090 that i have maxed out aa gaming cyberpunk control shadow of the tomb raider with rtx on and everything maxed out can't break 60fps average at 4k i'm trying to move to an lg cx or c1 4k 120hz oled soon but if i can't push those pixels it's far less valuable also this lhr bs they're into these days is crazy right now you can buy a 3080 with about 110ish mh and play pretty much everything or you can buy a 3080ti which provides about the same performance in gaming but half the hash rate at an msrp that's a few hundred more why would you pay more for them to gimp the performance smh i just wish that these companies would concentrate on pushing the highest end products that they can and then let people who don't want to pay current gen prices buy previous generation product gpu manufacturers could save a ton of money passing that on to consumers if they got rid of their 5 gpu model lines and concentrated on just the top one or two like a 3080 and a 3090 and continued to produce previous generation models like a 2080 and 2080ti longer making them less expensive over time to appease folks who are looking for more budget options and if they did that for a few generations we'd probably have 2080ti's at the cost of something like a 3060 because they become less expensive to produce over time due to reusing all that tooling distribution box art packing lines etc etc logistics for a way longer period of time it would probably also help iterate because gpu manufacturers engineers don't have to bring out so many different designs and software teams don't have nearly as much product they need to support so qa would be better etc ,0,May-21
0, if nvidia is waiting to see pricing to potentially drop pricing on the 3070 i'm not going to be sad about this at all ,0,Sep-20
0, so nvidia is making e waste again 12 months from now when the bull market is long over there will be stacks of mining cards that can't be used for anything ,0,Feb-21
0, thermal overhead how about a card that is actually quiet i went out of my way to find a quiet card just to fail ,1,Aug-21

0, i'm surprised gainward is still around i haven't seen anything from them in ages i know i had a gainward card way back and i remember it was factory overclocked but i can't remember what the heck it was for a moment i thought it might have been a voodoo card but no i had a canopus voodoo card with 6mb instead of the standard 4mb afaik only canopus and intergraph made voodoo cards with 6mb then i had a pair of creative voodoo2 8mb cards and those served me well for a year or two looking at pictures i'm pretty sure i then got a gainward geforce 2 ti 500 or possibly a geforce 3 ti i remember that heat sink and the colors that must have been in 200 or 2001 so that was about 20 years ago by now ,0,Aug-20
0, stop buying new gfx cards wait for at least 6 months from releasing so you get them for lower prices and will stop manufacturers using your intense desire to increase the prices ,0,Nov-20
0, finally so we can buy that gpu its been months and its hard to get one and im not even a miner ,0,Apr-21
0, so what exactly was nvidia expecting even if lmg jay and others couldn't stand hw unboxed they'd look like idiots taking nvidia's side in the argument or staying silent about it you can't just single out a neutral 3rd party reviewer and blacklist him for the dumbest reasoning ever and expect anyone else doing similar things to be fine with it ,0,Dec-20
0, so many people saw the overstocking of gpus coming loo not that im complaining that just means hopefully super low prices but i swear if nvidia does try any bull crap that he mentioned i swear ill go as far as to dig them up in the desert with my bare hands ,0,Jun-18
0, i think its a play by nvidia they are waiting for the amd release if nvidia released in october then dropped price in november all it would do is piss off customers who bought the card ,0,Sep-20
0, people need to stop bitching about this 30 50 fps with rt turned on in games that's pretty damn good considering the compute power required also it's a hybrid card using both rasterization and ray tracing ,0,Aug-18
0, so me having a win7 pc with a gtx 770 and gtx 745 mixed with an rtx card in it is a problem i can't update drivers ever again or will it be possible to update the drivers and the 700 series and the rtx will just be running different versions of the driver oh wait i forgot they are stopping support for win7 too are they killing 700 series drivers for linux too ,0,Jun-21
0, if all you focus is on rasterization then it is unfair i think nvidia has a point if ray tracing is a big point then it has to be covered ,0,Dec-20
0, why not just skip the cards and do the processing on the cloud it sounds crazy but that's the future ,0,Oct-19
0, well if ur getting the new so ill be ok with taking ur last gen card to make room for ur new stock cough cough ,0,Jun-18
0, good luck getting any of those amd or nvidia chips i can't even get excited about anything amd does because all their stuff comes from tsmc and good luck getting enough chips made when they're at or over capacity from every other customer they have ,0,May-21
0, i will never pay 1 grand for a video that who'se purpose is not meant for professional graphics content creation that actually makes me real consistent career grade cash rtx 2080ti should be 800 bucks at most the first gen in almost anything is never worth buying wait for the 2nd or 3rd for the manufacturer to work the bugs out ,73,Aug-18
0, also holy shit you out of touch boomers just turn down your settings bitch am i going to turn down the settings on the gpu i don't have while i sit waiting for one on the second hand market to not be price hiked to death holy fuck ,0,May-21
0, member when the 5700xt came out how i said we could get 120cu if amd was willing to risk yeild losses from a die the size of the 2080ti well looks like they did it but saved a bit of die area by making it a compute only card ,0,Nov-20
0, consider yourself a favour and don't buy a gpu till feb next year i e when nvidia actually launches their new gen series ti super which will be waay more bang for buck the thing to see is that if amd has learned anything from the last time ,0,Nov-20
0, lol nvidia i hope you choke on all 300 00 of them fat chance i'm gonna rush out and buy a 10 gfx card now off nvidia in till they drop prices on them drastically ,1,Jun-18
0, you need an rtx card thought we could run raytracing on the 100 gtx series albeit with a bigger performance hit ,0,Aug-19
0, speak for yourselves i have a gtx 1060 still if i can actually get a hold of this card i'll be happy with it ,0,Sep-21
0, isnt nvidia buying arm for 40 million dollars seem low isnt it 4 or 40 billion there houses moe expensive thant that ,0,Sep-20
0, hopefully the noctue card will allow for replacable fans like the aftermarket solution from morpheus or at least like the gainward phantom which was discontinued with pascal asus actually has been the best option for the morpheus already as the strix cards offered a casefan header meaning you could control aftermarket casefans directly by gpu temperature ,1,Aug-21
0, hey dummy you cant mine bitcoin profitably with gpus and ethereum has billions of dollars in volume and hundreds of thousands of transactions per day we need the miners we are the enthusiasts if you never used a dapp on ethereum you are missing out ,0,Dec-20

0, it doesn't look like ddr6 so i don't think that's a picture of a gtx 2080 and wouldn't they have more ddr slots plus the wattage is too high i think this is something else ,0,Jul-18
0, the real question with the new gtx card is how much better will it perform in terms of 4k gaming compared to the rtx 20xx line that's what i want to know since that seems like that would be a better bet at least short term considering how much of a performance drop you get with ray tracing to make it look good ,0,Jan-19
0, why is the nvidia crypto thing bad miners get more eficient hardware and gamers have more gpus helping with the current shortage can nvidia not do anything without ppl complaining ,0,Feb-21
0, lol right after tesla and uber broke up with nvidia mercedes steps in ready to learn why nvidia sucks the hard way ,0,Jan-19

0, dumb question what is wrong with nvidia cards that they die cause fps too high like what the f d ,0,Jul-21
0, don't be ridiculous no such card is passively cooled they just offload the airflow requirement to the chassis rather than attaching a fan if you try to cool such a card passively it will very quickly overheat and shut down ,0,Oct-20
0, odd that amd would use a numbering system that was last used on nvidias biggest flop cards with the dodgy drivers and poor performance ,0,May-19
0, trust me there is no difference between 12gb or 20gb 16gb would be only needed when games ready to run 8k over 60fps when current cards do not have horsepower do so yet while system memory is not fast enough for 16gb memory copy cycle ddr4 is not great for 8k gaming ddr5 kind it speed up the transfer by gonna more than 100gb s when fully reach maturity we won't see ddr6 for another 8 years later for the system memory while graphics gonna ddr7 very soon probally after 2 years ,0,Sep-21
0, i don't want to be waisting money on this card when i bought the 1080ti it had titan specs and a lot of people was mad because they bought the titan instead of the 1080ti cheaper price for expensive specs ,0,Jun-20
0, the whole reason behind the concept of mining was to allow decentralization by allowing the relatively average joes to take part in securing the network then asics came and took away that aspect from bitcoin now with ethereum too we have gpus which can only mine so the same as asics not something we'll ever find on consumer devices sure most miners are the larger scaled ones but now all the individual home user instances that strengthened decentralization will disappear good thing ethereum is ditching mining pow completely soon ,0,Feb-21
0, lol nvidia really doing everything to leave the brand i just want the founders eddition one if i don't have one by the time amd launches their new gpu line it's bye bye ,0,Oct-20

0, i hope to god that the current infestation of scalpers loose their asses on their cards instead of people buying them and anyone who is okay with paying scalper prices is just as bad as the people who waste money on loot boxes because youre facilitating this environment ,0,Nov-20
0, me sees the title also me with a 10 series gpu i dont have such weaknesses also remember this is just a joke and im saying sorry if you lost your 3090 because of these and i want to tell you that if you dont like the comment you need to know that if you think this comment is bad dont try to make the comment bad because its not just your opinion the one that matters is everyone else opinion not yours says bye and thanks for reading the comment ,0,Jul-21

0, so happy they are releasing 75 w cards for people with very little budget this is a fantastic upgrade gives a lot of additional longevity to older systems i am so happy i am almost crying that is how happy i am thank you nvidia you have given with this hope to a lot of companies which simply cannot afford a complete computer over hall to many people think everyone has just several hundred euros lying around for some that is a few years saving thank you nvidia ,2,Apr-19

0, well good luck i already know these videocards are gonna flop just like radeon 500 these cards will be unstable as always and go for a low price ,0,Jun-20
0, old games with rtx support half life or hl 2 the old fallout games would be great but i doubt it instead of quake maybe some of the doom games still wont be worth the price they want for them but at least people that had to shell out for them will get something plus nvidias next gen might be priced better with competition from amd out there ,0,Oct-19
0, i got an odyssey g9 and my 1080ti is struggling like hell wheres my gpu im waiting and waiting lol ,0,Nov-20
0, im sad now i originally got into gaming on a toshiba laptop back in the mid to late 200s i dont remember the specs of it but i do remember that it was amd and it probably had integrated graphics i also ended up dropping it from about 4 feet onto bricks and it still worked ,40,Aug-20

0, rtx 400 series not sound good enough just skip to rtx 500 series because number 4 is china unlucky number lol ,0,Apr-21
0, so its cool that nvidia is trying to make the next batch of 30 series cards un mineable but how many are they actually going to be able to make in this chip shortage are they only going to make a handful of gpus that will still sell out instantly because of them being very limited i hope whatever batch they end up releasing again can meet the demand ,0,Apr-21
0, amd is so based the only reason we have the vrr adoption we currently have is thanks to their freesync not the proprietary gsync now we get fsr thanks amd i'll try to get a radeon when i upgrade my 1060 ,1,Jun-21
0, no serious miner is going to mine shitcoins like the ones that use octopus and cortex algos and even if they do the profitability is going to take a huge dive cause they're small networks so yeah the nvidia guys know what they're doing ,0,Feb-21

0, you think this is why gpu prices increased by double and triple the msrp lol i can understand a 30 to 40 increase maybe even 50 increase but remember the msrp is what the manufacturer is selling the gpu for to the public if it costs them more money to manufacture the product the msrp will be almost the same as what the retailers are selling it for but the retailers are selling the gpus for double and triple the msrp that has nothing to do with what your talking about like i said if it costs the manufacturer more to make the gpu then the msrp would reflect that the msrp would be more ,0,Feb-21
0, the new amd gpu is being released in just 2 months amazing that they kept it quiet this long wow im excited just wait guys only 2 months until gpu prices go down and we all stop getting ripped off ,0,Jan-19
0, doesnt matter if they made the 30 series decent for mining as cryptocurrency will be dead by 2025 china has already banned it us and uk looking at banning it and rightly so as its primarily used for illegal activities as its untraceable the fact it will restore the gpu market will be a bonus ,0,Aug-21
0, wouldn't it be nice if we could actually get the rtx 30 cards before they start thinking about the 40 series ,0,Dec-20
0, display as car plate yeah cause there won't be a hack avaible in few months times which allows you do temporary disable your plate when racing past photobooth or the more nefariuos one where car thieves will just change the plate for the before prepared fake registration cards ,21,Jan-19

0, i kinda figured this would happen glad i was able to snag a 1650 i know it isn't that great of a card but it should be enough especially considering it was literally the only option ,0,Feb-21
0, i'll try to get one of these new cards by the end of q1 2021 at this point i be damned if i pay 50 over msrp for anything ,0,Nov-20
0, i have a rig of ps5 for mining i play on ps4 cause my pc is useless video cards out of stock everywhere can i mine gpu cause soon will worth more than bitcoin future gamers can play on rtx 3060 ti of a modest cost of 3 billion dollar piece are they too greedy no i don't think so ,1,Feb-21
0, so a 2060 is pretty much the same card but lets dedicate a bunch of time to make another card thats slightly less powerful they seriously need some competition i dont even know wtf they are doing anymore ,0,Feb-19
0, at this point who cares for new releases all i want a 400 dollars gpu that give me more performance and less power consuption than the one i allready got since more than 2 years ago ,0,Aug-21
0, well actually i think if i remember correctly when the crypto mining was afdecting gpu prices nvidia staded rhat they are not responsible for the high price but the retailers are so there's that ,0,Jun-18
0, i knew that nvidia mining gpu was a bad precedence being set this should have been illegal and i hope environmental agencies and government's around the world can use these fkers ,0,Mar-21
0, how about they start by actually providing the gpu chips thats been out now for a year before they stretch the silicon supply market more ,0,Apr-21
0, so 2020 brings us the rise of amd microwave ray guns nvidia goes dark side we finally got cyberpunk 2077 and who can forget covid and on a sadder note my father passed away this year cancer not the 'rona virus man 2020 sucks i bought a giant meteor 2020 sticker for my car back in 2019 now i'm feeling like it's less lol political joke and now lol yeah just end it already ,0,Dec-20

0, its going to make gamers angry lol yet theyll still buy from nvidia id you want these companies to change stop simping and just dont buy ,0,May-21
0, cant you realize the bigger story here they claimed that they had high prices because of shortage high demand and the industry not being able to respond to it and other bs only one manufacturer having three hundred thousand gpus and these only being the batch he returned just proves the scam scheme they had us consumers going into ,0,Jun-18
0, they didn't ruin the launch nvidia did by having only a few thousand cards available when there was 100x 100x the demand some people are going to be willing to pay thousands for them leading to a massive incentive for others to grab and flip them to equalize the price imbalance the scalpers are to be expected nvidia launching a product with almost no supply is not to be expected or tolerated they could have waited a month or two and prevented this from happening ,0,Sep-20
0, little do you know you can't ray trace camera footage you can only ray trace your downloaded gpu and ram ,0,Oct-18
0, jokes on you i bought the paper edition for double the price of the actual card itself so who really is the loser now scalpers ,0,Nov-20
0, cant get any gpus for 2 months apparently its even harder now tho i dunno what to think about this ,0,Jan-21
0, i think ray tracing is kinda pointless it's almost unnoticable i really see it having the same death as physx it's just gonna go ununsed by developers and it's clearly not 4 times better than the previous gen it's likely only 3 times faster at best at it's current price it's just not viable give it at least a year or 2 for nvidia to realize no one cares about ray tracing and that no one will buy the cards at that premium ,0,Aug-18
0, i was mailing my store bout the 3060 ti and i noticed they removed all of the 20 sires graphics and they sed they where all eol buy why do they still make the 1660 and 1650 then and i notice there is no middle class nvidi card now 3060ti starts at 620 noting below that and then there is 200 1660 no mid under 500 class f that bullshit ,0,Nov-20
0, never heard you guys say yo dont go buy this insert newest graphics card because your old graphics card can still run your new upcoming game ,0,Sep-20
0, with nvidia canvas now i can pretend to be a concept artist oh wait i don't have a graphic card ,0,Jun-21
0, getting real tired of nvidia launching some new refresh every time amd does like let them have some spotlight jeez ,1,Jun-19
0, nvidias solution to fixing a problem is to give it to best buy a company that didnt even start the xbox pre orders on time was like 4 hours late to the release and then when it because available it said sold out or unavailable or we could not make this order or when you put it in your basket and your basket said there was one item in it and you clicked on basket it said you had nothing in your basket so you had to start all over again thats nvidias solution sounds about right ,0,Oct-20
0, no one cared when it went from gt to gtx for the high end cards or from titanium to ti for that matter the rtx change is neither unprecedented nor surprising ,2,Aug-18
0, amd and nvidia can make all the money they want without price fixing i'd think they're the only two real games in town and pc gaming is a 35 billion a year industry ,0,Jul-19
0, at least these guys get it steve at gn seems to think the basic paper launch was nothing to get upset about and the gpu sellers did nothing wrong ,0,Sep-20

0, all of this nvidia amd sku madness can be resolved with a website punch in how much you have to spend and it will give you the best performance or the best efficiency for your dollar ,0,Apr-19
0, i think geforce now is amazing and totally unfair that the tittles are being removed with geforce now i am just renting a graphics card why should game publishers matter ,0,Feb-20
0, nvidia's driver was completely hack proof by any reasonable definition of hacking they were never hacked people just used an official nvidia driver to get around it completely no hacking required ,2,Apr-21
0, you know it's funny everyone is bemoaning the fact that there's no gpus at a decent price but when either company tries to do something to help everyone bitches about that too short version make up your minds now granted the 2060 12gb will probably be gone at launch but the short version is most of the general population doesn't care what gpu it is if it lets them game they're going to buy it ,0,Sep-21
0, honestly i would love a noctua themed gpu hell a whole nactua themed build could be cool i kinda like their aesthetic tbh ,0,Aug-21

0, seriously do they really think increasing resolution changes anything i stopped seeing detail increase at 1440p 4k is just gpu intensive and no real graphics upgrade over 1440p and now you wanna do 8k its like who cares ,0,Jun-19

0, nvidia fans excited to get their hands on rtx 30 series crpyto miners i am gonna end this man's career ,2,Nov-20
0, they should be charging less for them then but nvidia is being greedy screwing us instead it's standard business economics cripto wasn't causing the high gpu prices the gpu makers were by first not supplying the demand which normally should cause prices to go down when there's high demand for something and then now they artificially keep the prices high when they have high supply which is also not normal you price products less in order to get rid of inventory ,0,Jun-18
0, oof almost got caught in the valorant problem glad i upgrade just in time for i7 7700hq 1060 to i9 9900kf rtx3080 ,1,Sep-21

0, i am a saudi living in jeddah silicon valley which is the microcenter of saudi arabia is incredibly over priced so the card will probably cost 300ish ,0,Nov-20
0, so the shortage is nvidia's fault for not planning for the two sections of there users how is it the miners fault if nvidia knew that this was going to be the case ,0,Nov-20

0, any chance you could not make the same dumb expression to report on a gpu as everyone else if you must go really really over the top i'm going to downvote without even watching cause if it's the same face it's prob the same info too ,0,Oct-20
0, ps5 with backwards compatible games funk yeah baby buying and remember folks that 8k graphics it will likely only be for movies at like 30fps don't expect much there as for ray tracing no just no sorry amd not even nvidia can do it right and they are ahead of the lead i don't expect ps5 to do ray tracing in a meaningful way at least but a for trying ssds are a nice touch thou ,0,Apr-19
0, good sharpening is a more useful feature than ray tracing considering the state of current mainstream games so many modern games have no bad implementation of good aa or af then they cover the screen with vaseline effects and post processing garbage go back 10 years and you could just run a game at native and see the sharpness and fidelity you wanted damn i miss functional graphics at high fps ,1,Jun-19
0, i wonder if the radeon rx 6900 xt is better than my radeon 9600 xt why can't anyone name anything correctly they're clearly fish flounder cavefish why do we need funding to make an ironman suit it's for work yeah yeah that's it it's for saving people ,1,Sep-20

0, cyberport de worries me their range of gpu's give an eta of may or june depending on how you read verfgbar ab 2021 you reckon they know something or just being honest and saying like yeah give us 6 months ,0,Jan-21
0, it's easy to blame crypto miners especially if you're amd nvidia some huge cloud service or just a pc manufacturer this shortage isn't because of crypto miners they don't all buy new gpus every 6 months this is more likely to be deliberate price fixing by the manufacturers maybe in cooperation with manufacturers that wants to sell complete systems at 2 4 00 bucks ,0,Dec-20
0, it's not like a capacitor issue can be fixed by a software update yet evga has reported that a driver update from nvidia has ended the crashing problem on the cards with 6 poscaps ,1,Sep-20

0, i have a theory a game theory jk anyways what if you use the rtx shaders and use the hd resource pack would it be even better or will it kill your pc cuz minecraft is a laggy game in general ,0,Aug-19
0, the 3070 delay will do nothing scalpers just have more time to get more money for more cards lol the only way they can have consumers have the highest chance of getting a card is if they surprise drop them before the 29th this means scalpers wont have their bots ready say the 17th or even the original date the 15th ,1,Sep-20
0, lol why don't these miners get jobs like normal people instead of buying out all gpu's that gamers want just so they can run games ,2,Jan-21

0, i remember when i bought my pc that had a 780 the card itself was released in 2013 i bought my pc in 2014 and in 2018 i could still play alot of games on ultra minus the msaa but even after oc'ing the card i could boost the msaa to x4 and still have 55 60 fps on most games but nowadays lol you re lucky if your card can last 2 years thats why they removed 1080 and 1080 ti from their stock 1080ti performs the same as a fucking 2080 lol ,0,Aug-19
0, why tf would nvidia produce 2060 with 12gb ram when its already too hard to produce 3060 with 12gb of ram for a reasonable price reeks like a s class hit ,0,Sep-21

0, i assume that a large part of your audience is into games but we aren't all that way inclined i am someone who does video editing using adobe premiere i'm sure i'm not alone on this in that i don't give a toss about game performance so i tend to go down the path of thinking that if it is good for games it is good for video editing but i also suspect that is not true as hinted at in this video could you offer a diversion from the norm and discuss what sort of gpu would be a good card for those of us who are more into video editing but who are wary of saving up or shattering one's bank account on a card which turns out to be largely overpowered and wasted on this purpose when something more affordable would prove to be more than adequate for instance i edit videos that are 20 40 minutes long 1080 in format with chroma keying 2 effects cropping and repositioning yet get annoyed with having to wait 5 10 seconds for the preview in adobe to warm up while it jerks and skips making consistent edits difficult and frustrating what should someone like me be looking to do to fix this situation somehow going out and buying the latest and greatest simply seems a way to solve the problem by just throwing everything at it rather than understanding it ,0,Jul-19
0, i don't get how a game can fry a fucking graphics card why now why has this not happened before sounds like absolute bullshit trying to hurt a new game ,0,Jul-21

0, amd never gave up radeon vii was a mining card from the get go with a gaming side gig i guarantee if mining didn't fizzle they would be still pumping these out 100 m h out of the box for 699 and can be undervolted to sip power not to shabb still getting 86 m h it was marketed it as a gaming card just because of the negativity associated mining ,1,Jul-19

0, nvidia is executing the second stage of their plan inflating the best buy founders edition prices an allocating a small stock to best buy to keep the founder edition real they intended for the fe to be a very low margin card that generated excitement theyre phasing it out for third party cards so they earn more money from selling to those third parties ,0,Oct-20
0, fuck nvidia i was a beta tester for them and what do they do for my good feedback and help they dont give shit instead they give me a free tier no trials or help nothing nope nada nothing and i hate it i helped fix so much bugs by simply telling them from emails to using the feedback button still i hate it even though the premium membership is just it sucks ass though its not a bad deal for 15 a month on premium you get rtx longer playtime and better quality but i mean they still do nothing to credit or help beta testers if they keep making horrible decisions i might just become full on amd ,0,Feb-20

0, nvidia if you got an extra 980 or 1080 hook a streamer up 3 looking for a 8gb card but i have no real complaints with my 760 it works great for almost anything i've needed it for but doing graphical edits and experimenting with ai and neural networks that extra power can really come in handy ,0,Jun-18

0, so let me get this straight minecraft requires rtx 2060 to run but quake 2 can do it with a gtx 1060 god that game's gotta be one of the more poorly optimized pieces of garbage on the planet ,0,Aug-19
0, funny because nvidia cards are only able to run newer games in 4k by upscaling too that's what dlss is ,0,Mar-21
0, i can't wait for the release of the rtx 2080 just think of all the people who will sell their gtx 1050 1080ti cards maybe the price will drop enough for me to upgrade my gtx 750ti finally p ,0,Aug-18
0, one more reason for nvidia to not release 12nm cards they could have kept milking pascal and skip 12nm cards wouldnt skipping 12nm cards save them money they wouldnt need to have developed or manufacture 12nm chips i dont know how it works but i guess right doubt 12nm cards will sell alot when they will be released in q3 2018 and next year there will be 7nm cards out pascal to 12nm cards most likely wont be worth upgrading waiting for 7nm still is better sure people with money can buy now and upgrade later but most people dont have that money unless 7nm cards release only in q4 2019 in that case its a 1y wait thats very long but amd already to release 7nm vega for workstation i dont think 7nm cards will be repeased later than q2 2019 but i dont know ,0,Jun-18
0, rtx twothousandeighty is overpriced crap who tf wants blurry shadows overexaggerated lights on everything so far from reality it hurts you eyes no thanks nvider'a keep ur scammer cards ,0,Aug-18
0, im so confused if there is a chip shortage then why are companies going out of their way to make graphics cards with different chips rather than just putting more resources into making more of their sold out graphics cards to bring them back in stock ,1,Sep-21
0, so what the fuck gtx 1050 and up are just fucked why wouldnt i be able to play hd minecraft this fkn sucks ,0,Aug-19
0, so in 5 years the 5500 will produce 60fps at 1080p resolution cards are stupid a 2080 ti is a 720p card given time ,1,Oct-19
0, nvidia ending support for kepler is why we need open source drivers for linux that's why i exclusively buy amd gpus as i'll have up to date drivers for the forseeable future gcn and newer gpus have open source drivers in the kernel ,0,Jun-21
0, nvidia is the biggest trolls now rtx 3090 super no one gives a shit you know what nvidia release the rtx 3090 ti as well do it i know you will ,0,Aug-21
0, i was thinking of upgrading my 1080 ti to an ampere but i really wanted one that looked like the rtx 2080 reference designs aibs tend to make them too big i only have slot space in my itx case ,0,Jun-20
0, i don't understand how uk govt can stop nvidia from taking arm arm belonged to a japanese company and nvidia purchased arm from them already so how can uk govt stop something that is already done i mean neither nvidia nor softbank is uk based ,0,Apr-21
0, how about nvidia stop being scrooges and maybe use the glut of inventory to lower prices on current models while preparing for the next gen ,0,Jun-18
0, right so what could they possibly change in every new football game they release every year you cant change the rules of it so wtf is the point the graphics are also pretty much at the point i cant tell the difference so idk i cant imagine thats the whole thing ,0,Jun-20
0, nvidia please stop fckg up and just name it gtx2060 no we the customers won't get confused with gtx2060 and rtx2060 ,0,Jan-19
0, nvidia just sunk 10 years of net income into arm for what exactly good deal for softbank though amirite interested to see what nvidia does with arm going forward they've been a bit of a hungry hippo the last few years with their acquisitions kind of smells rotten though when a company just starts mass buying in an effort to keep growing it's worked for some and it's caused nothing but headache for others ,0,Sep-20
0, nvidia trying to virtue signal since this stupid tactic won't solve shortage anyways they both use same chip not like they said they won't sell to miners altogether one who comes up with these non solution marketing stunts should be fired ,0,Feb-21
0, the miner cards did exactly what they wanted them to as did the restriction on mining on the 30 series cards ,0,Feb-21
0, before the game maybe as a reference to the fact that you install a graphics card before you can play a game ,0,Aug-18
0, people rushing a microcenter for gpus is sad on many fronts i like gaming but i won't even negotiate a calm crowd of people just to get a graphics card a few months earlier let alone if it's an angry overweight mob ,0,May-21
0, please tell me amd's instinct m100 is awesome for mining so miners will leave the good gaming cards to the people who will give them the most love ,0,Nov-20
0, the planned graphical update for minecraft thesuper duper graphics pack has beencanceled says an announcement from mojang 3e party mods in able retracing on more than just nvidia and now they do this shit ,0,Aug-19
0, i deadass was thinking a gt 3030 i was hyped its estimated to be a gtx 1050 ti for 80 and the gt 1030 is already great for sff pcs ,0,Jan-21
0, oh god the thumbnail you really really want it to be nvidia don't you amd apus yeah they're pretty popular for budget builds ,0,Dec-19
0, more interested in radeon vii crossfire compatibility because one of my redeon vii already on the way and thinking about second one ,0,Feb-19
0, nvidia does exactly what ati did around 2006 lunching dozens of similar performant graphic cards with variing prices so you end up getting a better card for only 10 more makes you wonder why the 10 cheaper but significantly slower card existed in the first place i mean seriously who would buy a 1650 or a 1660 if there will be a cheap 2060 who will buy a 6 gb 2060 if there will be an 8 gb 2060 super for a few extra bucks it's a mess ,0,Jun-19
0, nvidia is so great i still waiting for my order rtx 3080 from release day and they are releasing new one wtf ,0,Feb-21
0, im a pc builder from way back i have a 1080ti i was going to buy an asus 3090 strix for work and gaming since all this shit unavailability etc ive decided to not get a new gpu we bought 3 oculus 2s for the kids and myself and im not sure that im going to go back to pc gaming im having much more fun with the kids on these vr devices fuck u nvidia ,0,Feb-21
0, it's crazy how ray tracing is finally becoming a reality in videogames i remember ray tracing being talked about as the future of video games like 15 years ago now after all this time finally have the hardware to do it in videogames in real time at 60fps i can't wait to see what the second and third generation of these rtx cards will do and how far graphics will be pushed with ray tracing we'll definitely start getting much closer to the look of movie pixar quality cgi ,0,Aug-18
0, the question then being why only the rtx 3060 why not the 3060ti 3070 3080 too because nvidia doesn't want to piss off it's mining partners ,0,Feb-21
0, so the rx 5700 xt will compete in performance with an rtx 2070 but be 50 cheaper isn't nvidia reducing the pricing on the 2070 soon though to make room for the rtx 2070 super lol bad timing amd ,1,Jun-19
0, nvidia needs to announce the launch of the 3090 super ti 3091 3092 4090 5091 300900900 super after all you cannot find anything at msrp so who cares what they launch if you want to game right now it makes more sense than ever to buy a gaming laptop is a laptop 3070 the same as a desktop no but hell you can get a 2070 laptop for 1800 yea entire laptop or you can drop 500 on a 1660ti or 850 on a 3060 meaning that a desktop 3060 will cost you likely as much as 3070 laptop with near to similar performance ,0,Aug-21
0, i'm glad they crippled the gpu we already have shortages and really don't need those cryptocurrency miners buying off 10 gaming gpus at the time driving up the price for the rest of us give them special low quantity production ones without gpu ports and made exclusively for mining i'll rather have a shortage in mining gpus than paying extra for the gaming gpu shortage ,1,Feb-21
0, about sponsor i never had a credit card i have always used temporary virtual credit card just use your national id smartcard to log into your bank and make new virtual credit card for specific sum and use it safely to order stuff from internet it's always been that easy and safe why you need additional service ,0,Jan-19
0, whilst it might be a cunning plan i think the actual reason for nvidia's delay is to do additional testing on the 3070 to avoid the bad publicity around the 3080 crashing at launch ,0,Sep-20
0, i'm here after the 2nd gen rtx launch event boy that design looks sweet also the performance price just made me replace my 2080 ,0,Aug-20
0, nvidia finally realized that the only games that would run well on their rtx cards are from 20 years ago ,0,Oct-19
0, i feel like it would have been smarter for nvidia to unveil the new cards sooner since everyone will be buying back to school computers right before it's released ,6,Aug-20
0, i hope the next i am this early there is 100 laptop in market not lenovo or acer which is sleek portable premium looking and has atleast an nvidia mx350 preferably a 1050ti graphics chip and has 14 inch screen and 2 in 1 factor although its seems impossible right now but maybe the next time i am this early btw if anyone knows any such laptop plz tell ,0,Nov-20
0, nvidia sold 175 million dollars worth of gpu's to minors what's the legal age to buy a gpu these days ,0,Nov-20
0, are you fucking serious i just spend last 2 days learning all nooks and cranies about how to pass through a single gpu to the windows vm on linux literally got it working 2 hours ago and now they make it easier i just hope it doesn't f up the solution i'm using right now ,0,Mar-21
0, some people aren't gonna like it but there likely is a software fix for these troubled rtx 30 series cards update the vbios to limit the maximum clockspeed the card will run at ,0,Sep-20
0, i would also be jacking up the price of cards because the bitcoin is going up and up and up ,0,Feb-21
0, nvidia done fucked up on that crypto craze i hope they slash the prices so i can get me a high end gpu before xmas ,0,Jun-18
0, miners need their own fucking card anyway how are we gamers supposed to use the ones for gaming if the dumbass miners buy them all up in bulk fucking miners ,0,Feb-21
0, i'm building my first mining rig now i would not even consider buying a mining card they have no resale value i'm buying everything on ebay i plan to sell everything on ebay eventually mining difficulty is always increasing and old cards fall below the power efficiency threshold that would be needed to mine profitably then i need to know that i can resell my hardware to gamers a mining card won't cost much less upfront but would always become e waste soon worthless to everyone especially gamers also i'm a gamer more than a miner even if i didn't plan to build a mining rig i'd want to keep mining on my laptop i only got into crypto because i could mine it on my laptop with a gtx 1060 i want to keep mining to help pay for my next laptop to be better the main thing nvidia's ethash limiter on the 3060 accomplishes is breaking the cycle for ordinary gamers who mine cryptocurrency with their one graphics card also it will hurt the resale value of the cards when gamers sell them if it even works any miner crafty enough to break the pseudo drm will be able to resell a 3060 to other miners for more money than a gamer ever can ever sell their stock 3060 for what a horrible new era cryptocurrency designers design their cryptocurrencies explicitly to be asic resistant and keep control out of the hands of any mining companies or specialized manufacturers and in the hands of hobbyists and gamers and nvidia and amd are both actively fighting this effort just to possibly sell more power to the gamers amd is still doing pretty well by us because it isn't pretending that crypto limiting a mainstream card is a good idea but both companies are making cards that they know are useless to gamers and want us to assume they have the best intentions they don't miners don't buy a mining card gamers don't buy the 3060 an even better gpu from either company could mine ethereum or vertcoin for a few hours each night while you sleep and easily pay for the difference between the 3060 and the better gpu let your hardware work for you and send a message that you don't want to give up that ability vertcoin is designed to be minable in the background without slowing down your computer so you might even be able to mine that during the day though i haven't tried it ,0,Mar-21
0, talks about not having any cards available literally has like 20 cards in their warehouse for testing and stuff kk ,0,Dec-20
0, me when i get to see another newly manufactured gpu get sold out stop posting about graphics card shortage am tired of seeing it ,0,Aug-21
0, it feels like gpu's will never be readily available ever again with scalpers and crypto miners buying them all up and or rasing the price ,39,Dec-20
0, i would feel sorry for the gamers for taking their gpus but then i realized that gamers are usually fat or frail get good at life newbs not some fake life in a computer ,0,Nov-20
0, it was 10 years since i paid at the pump and was in a hurry earlier this year and decided to give it a go within one week of paying at the pump someone on a different state was trying to use my card at an atm no mas ,8,Dec-19
0, seems like nvidia saw a gap in the market for temporary placeholder gpus for new pc builders until stock arrives ,0,Jan-21
0, you know how overpriced nvidia is if elon musk thinks developing their own chip is cheaper than outsourcing to nvidia ,0,Jul-18
0, i guess trump runs nvidia now imagine that maybe he will make a game that he actually won the election and maybe in the end they show him and putin in bed ,0,Dec-20
0, i see what you did there more rtx 300 cards had me thinking oh nvidia is releasing more cords to try and out compete the bots no just different models and the bots will get those too ,3,Nov-20
0, so what will be next will nvidia start producing its own ram modules again as wel or even ram chips would be an interesting development ,1,Apr-21
0, to mention an example of how powerful ray tracing is in the early 200s using ldraw as a model builder and povray as a renderer i managed to render lego sets that looked like the real thing that is how powerful ray tracing is but it is useless for any games and i mean literally any games because there are no games that are ready to render with ray tracing if you are a media creator who works in 3d modeling these video cards are a fucking wet dream but as a gamer they are currently useless ,2,Aug-18
0, let's be fair no one hacked the limiter nvidia just massively screwed up and released a driver that lets you bypass it not the same thing as hacking it ,0,Apr-21
0, im still going to get an amd big navi card but the performance of the rx 6900xt only trades blows with the 3090 because it has its new smart memory active along with rage mode look at the bottom of the amd slides and you will see that their benchmarks has them included ,0,Oct-20
0, when nvidia tries to innovate some gamers rant when resolution bump up to 8k 16k some gamers praises it lol what a weird world ,0,Aug-18
