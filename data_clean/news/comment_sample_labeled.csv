0,Convinced that anyone can host techlinked. Seriously literally every host is good
0,"Damn, Anthony could do some solid RPG voice over, like an angry wizard or something"
0,Talk about biased....   Intel Z390 Motherboards are more affordable. X570 motherboards need a fan to cool the chipset (fan lifespan only rated for 2 years...). 9700k outperforms all Ryzens in gaming.    I'll be getting a new 9700k build soon. Ryzen almost had me convinced...but research shows 9700k is still best option and price for gaming.

0,Waitttt Google will be charging the SAME fee as Apple but it is cool now because you can side load on android? Can sideload on ios 14 and below with AltServer. Weirdddddd how people freaked out when Apple did it but not Google doing it soon 
0,Hmm steam has all games and ppl naught to many steam games so they can't go down
1,Bruh I wanted an RTX 2060 with 12GB VRAM bruh
1,I did not have any problem buying a RTX 3000 series card in my country... The local shop had stock of 3060ti and 3070 cards... They are however very expensive for most people here though. A 3070 cost nearly 2x as much as a 1070 used to go for.
0,Linus skin is on point!

0,stop joking about the virus you twit
0,samsung has edge lighting which probably still works better lmao
0,Do any tech tubers ever actually look at prices before they make videos? Ryzen 3 series chips dropped prices months ago and have maintained those lower prices. They are NOT the same price as the new ones.
1,i hope they launch with supers/ti directly fir the simple reason that that means they have a bigger gap between 3070 and 3080ti that needs to be filled with cards so we may see a large jump on the most expensive card.
0,Red team for life boi
0,Its a TRAP!!! Riley doesn't host Wednesday techlinked... so will never get the song :(

1,So cyberpunk 77 another game full of bugs and glitches at launch. yet everybody is going to buy it because they havent learn anything in the past couple of years with the games being released full of bugs and glitches. and even after shit tons of patches they still dont work. yap people are idiots. they never learn. they buy the game they bitch about glitches and bugs speak shame over the company and move on. and when another game is going to be released they do the exact same thing again. man humans can be so stupid. literally no point in updating your pc or getting new parts because there is literally no point in it. i still game on a 6 year old pc. i can run this game on high settings 60FPS in 1080p. and i get the exact same experience and gameplay as people who bought a rig that can handle this game in 4K ultra settings. man how easy is it to fool people.
0,That first 15 seconds are the reason we like Riley the best. o/ James second. Sorry James.

I'd take me a year as an unemployed child a good ryzen board and the processor cost nearly 300 euros and an i5 9400f cost 140 euros so it will be easier to save money for it. The new intel cpus are like a remastered more pricy versions of the 9th gen ones. I wish i had more money to buy a ryzen board and processor, screw you intel."
0,intel boutta make their cpu 1x better and make the price 5x more
0,"If you can't explain the game stonk situation properly, don't try to explain it at all. It has nothing to do with Reddit or Wall Street bets... It has to do with a shitload of people seeing that they shorted it over 130%. Of course dumb people on Reddit (can't use the appropriate reddit word here) jumped in on it. Guaranteed free money. At least as guaranteed as the stock market can be.  what happened is some hedge fund people did something really really dumb. Never short a stock over 100%. It should be a law that keeps them from doing that but since there's not... You can get trapped like this and lose billions.... Rightfully so."

0,They said limited to best buy.. not to limiting it to in store purchases... so all they did is give their stock to another online retailer....

0,"The only thing I can say about Steam is that for a game like FFXIV, there's a free trial. After the free trial, if you buy the game, you can freely choose platform to play in. HOWEVER, if you did it on Steam, you're locked to Steam. That is kinda scummy. I don't play much on Steam and don't know of other instances, but that particular one stood out to me."
0,Just what we need mobile products for another year of non mobile stuck at home life.
0,I really like James. I really like Riley. I'm glad Linus got them.
0,Who tf is linus sebastian i came here for linus tech tips
0,"i find all their ""attempts"" to stop scalpers to be bullshit.  if you truly wanted to stop scalping, you only allow brick and mortar store sales of your products and limit 1 per customer.  at the very least limit severely the stock you make available to online retailers and heavily stock up brick and mortar stores.  i guarantee this will stop scalping almost immediately at next product launch"

0,going to be failed in india $300 thing is going to sold at $500 like wtf
0,"It's worth noting that the faceplate seller Sony went after was called ""Platestation"", so it's probably a case of trademark infringment. I sinerely _hope_ they're not claiming that no one can make custom faceplates at all. That would be a total dirtbag move, and I'd be surprised if it's even legal."

0,yyyyyessss maddie welcome back !
0,I wonder if the 5600X would be compatible whit the RTX 3070? And I would assume its better then all of Intels CPUs? I have no known knowledge on Ryzen's CPUs as to how long I've trusted Intel. And Advice?

1,"Fun fact : Xbox series S GPU is weaker than Xbox one X GPU.    Here is why :  Base on my calculation, 4 Tflops 1280 CU and 224gb/S memory bandwidth make series S GPU is weaker than Xbox one X GPU and RX 5500xt. Even with rdna 2.0 IPC gain, it is still weaker than Xbox one X. Series GPU sit below RX 580, i do multiple calculation and the result still same.  In conclusion , series S won't able to  play Xbox one games with ONE X mode graphics settings and only able to play Xbox one orginal graphics(without one X enhancement). Series S is really really direct successor of Xbox one/S. Not to replace Xbox one X."

AMD Navi has not even doubled performance per watt or per dollar after 3 long years since Polaris or PS4 Pro. There is no way to support AAA games in 8K or in 4K 120 frames per second. Even 4K 60fps will be very difficult to achieve (but possible with superb optimization)."

Just a few days ago thy named a project of MAUI toolkit, completely ignoring that there has been a MAUI toolkit by kde out there for years. They are both multi platform  toolkits. They said they had legal look over this, which means they well knew that the name was taken and some of the developers have been arguing that nobody ever heard of the older MAUI toolkit (which is still being developed). So it was ok to take the name. Although they are now negotaiting stuff like this means that big chunks of the linux community (including me) just won't buy the microsoft loves linux stuff."

I don't have a Huawei phone (nor do I want one nor have I ever wanted one), but unless the government is gonna pay to replace every phone that gets denied service, they should fuck off with that and just enforce a trade ban (i.e., leave existing phones as is). If the phone networks were designed securely then the only security vulnerability is to the consumer using the phone and everyone they communicate with; i.e., it's on them if they choose to keep using the device.

Microsoft sometimes takes great pains to not break backwards compatibility with applications, even poorly written ones, so it may have simply been easier to start fresh with Windows 10."

Now 8K is a joke, I bet its like the PS4 Pro which Sony keeps throwing 4K on everything and it only has very small number of 4K games, most are 1080 or 1440P with checkerboard trickery which is still far from the same game on a PC natively at 4K specially if you get close to the TV you see a huge difference...   Just like the normal PS4 1080P still has a few games going below 1080P lool... not the mention the poor Xone which is even far worse... Though Xone X really have a good number of actual 4K games, but then again they are not exactly also all Ultra 4K 60 FPS with best AA and shitz like that compared to the PC version either..."

They want to do questionable things online, like masterbate to videos of women and children getting violently abused and gang raped, then hide it from women they know irl.  The deleting of browser history does not get rid of it server side, it only deletes it locally so the wife doesn't find out that she married Hannibal Lector.  Men are fine with corporations and the government collecting and keeping data about them.  Men have no real sense of privacy.  They couldn't care less about other men watching them.  They only want to hide their despicable actions from women and keep them in the dark so that men can control them."

I really don't get their thought process.

They provide your data to ANOTHER entity that CAN tie that data to you so that they can fill your digital dossier and share or sell it to 3rd parties, until that info works its way to all companies and criminals in the world that want it. How very transparent, their insidiously tricky ways of taking your data while you think it's safe! Yay! If they were really serious, they would change their EULA from ""you want Google to take all your data and Google owns it"" to ""Google will not collect your data nor share any of your data with anyone else so it remains private, and you own your data"". Notice that their EULA still says the opposite to any of the claims that were presented in this video, and has not changed. They are liars and are lying."
