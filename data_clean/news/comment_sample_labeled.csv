0,I've seen tons of concept cars since I was a little kid. I'm now 25 and exactly 0 of those turned into a real car.
0,talks about halo 3 shows screenshot from ODST
0,So more space junk in orbit great 
0,Honestly for gaming there's no reason to choose AMD over Intel or vice versa except for a few edge cases games don't take advantage of all the cores the processor has and Intel and AMD end up having similar performance for competing processors EX: ryzen 7 v i7 . Yes in the most games and AMD is likely better but probably not to where you'd notice without looking at the frames per second or other performance metrics.
0,Frankly I have no idea why you would want to upgrade your CPU every year and if you did I would assume you would be having heaps of cash which if you did I don't know why it would be a problem to buy a new board after two or three generations
0,Hello may u have a great day
0,Yvonne & Riley combination is the best this was the best techlinked EVER Yvonne is such a natural & hilarious presenter. okay yes shes beautiful as well but Im not going to even mention that

0,Its good to see i wasn't the only o e who chunked up this year. Thicc boy summer 
0,I love you dennis No homo
0,To be honest I feel that most people pick Intel because it was more common for a long time and don't know the equivalent for AMD Most people look at just i3 i5 and i7 while also looking at generation.
0,Even better question. What was Intel doing for the last 10 years 
0,I still wouldn't buy anything from Intel EVER They used to be an American company. Until they sold out. AMD is made in Malaysia. If I ever had to upgrade I will stay with AMD. Of course my first computer I built was an AMD k62 500 MHZ. That computer was BADASS back then. I still like my x1700.
0,The Fry's by me looked like it was going out of business almost 3 years ago.
0,I bet The Google console is going to be the next Apple pippin
1,3060 12 GiB is the 1660 miners card of today but I don't advise buying one for 4 mining when recovering ur 300 purchase over 1 year because [that's the NVDA pitch its all systematic marketing conditional subliminal but maybe NVDA is correct but may not be correct. If u really are a participant in the massive GPU mining boom u r lot so just forget it. mb

0,Every Thursday morning I know there will be a video for my train journey
1,This will be 4k 60 across the board with the option of 1080 at 120fps
0,ARM will replace X86 64 in the long term that is pretty inevitable in the longer term RISC V might replace ARM but at this point way too early to call. X86 64 is an archaic beast that long passed it's prime. The question is just how long until ARM replaces X86 64 obviously in the case of Apple that already happened and most phones tablets and other forms of mobile device ARM is dominate. PCs will be the hard case to crack long established OSs will take time to migrate over and ARM cpus do have a few issues which would need addressing like adding more PCI e lanes to the design for handling things like discrete GPUs better.

0,What if you all been blinded by your silly minds Imagine y2k How was it fixed Remember I do. They wrote code to move the dates around. So year 00 became 2000 and they did the fix as in 2020 will be the year that all old system should been changed. Oops if it ain't broken dont fix it. Did they forget So 2020 was y2k20 and that is why airplanes had to be grounded. Stick market had to be halted and big money transfers un banks had to be cut down. Now new mainframes had to be built and bought and installed. Humm now shortage in silicon Why well many big mainframes had to be changed. So cut the sales of the retailers. Oops.

0,Wow. Linus is back with his pre Covid looks.
0,It's not tesla's fault people are generally stupid and majority is ignorant. Trust me you'd be surprised that the average person's level of intellect is depressingly low. Also humans are surprisingly shitty drivers. I mean majority suck at driving. I'm talking about 70 to 80% here.
0,I'd rather have Sara Butts. Yes.Madison is already comfy in front of the camera but she's annoying and tries too hard.

0,Doesn't like The Mandalorian GTFO
1,Expecting Intel to hit it out of the park on their first consumer discrete video card is silly. The same expectation wasn't put on Nvidia or ATI AMD back in the day when they were competing with 3DFX.
0,No Pre orders and almost all sold out on Newegg.
0,GeForce Now was just too good and the publishers took notice. Greedy on their part in my opinion.

0,I was unsure of this new lady but then she demanded I watch the whole video and then murdered Riley to make an example so she can stay.
0,Ok so I've had the Commuter 2 for about 5 months now.best portable speaker ever. Buy it. The stereo effect after splitting is fantastic with great bass mids and highs. Sit on a cliff lay in a hammock draw under a tree take a timelapse.all in stereo bliss without headphones. Oh.and when you go kayaking with your girlfriend Split that shit and put your phone in mono audio mode now you have TWO speakers perfectly in sync on each kayak

1,Wow. That's a lot of money you have invested in some pretty powerful equipment. You must develop some amazing stuff. Nope just gaming . Oh. Like games that help you code for the government or CAD up specs for new electric cars . Nope. Just games where I shoot aliens after I finish my double shift at TMobile. I just put it all on my credit card . Mother of god we're doomed
0,Me: just woke up Linus: Get some rest you look tired Me: Damn Linus you right
0,lets hope the meds to cure them won't be too expensive
0,Foldable PC so it will be one of the few laptops with an oled screen. Interesting.
0,Oculus is useless if it requires Facebook
1,I'll no longer be a gamer by the time the next GPUs come out.
0,Intel needs to pull more than a rabbit out a hat to get my attention.
0,Is it me or does Alex have more of a student reading off the board really slowly vibe compared to James or Riley 
0,What is it with all those idiotic Epic exclusives Ah well more money saved.

0,THE BEST TECH NEWS CHANNEL 
0,The GT 1010. a solution in search of a problem.
0,There was a hands on of the xCloud at E3 so it's wrong to say they didn't give it much attention.
0,Haha watch Apple buy a majority stake in ARM.
0,Honestly I watch every video with Anthony in it just because I love that guy.
0,it's gif Linus. hard G.
0,Jif is peanut butter gif is an image format.

0,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL Thats true manly man things
0,James I sincerely hope you never have kids
0,There is a reason we all like steam all other launchers are AWEFUL I reinstalled my pc and steam just magically finds my games on my 2nd SSD but if my 2nd SSD is full epic and other launchers demand the full size of the game to be present before it rediscovers files
0,Oh Riley you so funny.
0,The human eye can only see one Linus.
1,The AMD news here is just click bait. All other news sites are showing how that came out from an Intel funded research. Something you never talked about.
0,Give this lady a job please.

0,KNOCK KNOCK Who's there Nobody that's my PC PSU fan dieing.
0,Microsoft understands that the future is gaming as a service and not about selling black boxes that people can put next to their TVs. We'll see how long they keep making Xbox but if their game streaming gets really good that could completely change how the average person consume games. Having used their enterprise products though I'm not impressed by their cloud infrastructure Excel Online is slow as hell.
0,Taco Tuesday Im enjoying TechLinked Tuesday 
0,S on intel during last couple videos and then gets sponsored by them anyway lol
0,But if alphabet buy out rare.
1,I'm not first buuuuuut that 3060 looooks gooooooood

0,Havent seen Taran for a long time . My god he looks way different
0,is today Wednesday I must have missed some time calculations.
1,Im impressed at how the radeon software autodetected and autoenabled freesync on my rx5700xt pc. I refuse to overpay for nvidia sync so my gtx 1080 system will learn to use freesync or do without
0,And for more Quickety Quacks: Blizzard has delayed the next World of Warcraft expansion named Shadowlands indefinitely but apparently it'll be out by the end of the year .
0,Only Jesus can save you 
1,Donald Trump is better than Biden. Intel is better than Amd. Nvidia is better than amd.
0,LTTtrash.com redirects already. James did you force them to buy another .COM 
1,Thats crazy how you can pay 100k for the graphics cards to mine and recoup from mining within the year and prolly sell the cards at a relatively small discount. Essentially doubling your money.
0,Where were you when you realized this was just a dad joke news show 
0,ANTHONY ANTHONY ANTHONY ANTHONY ANTHONY ANTHONY

1,Nvidia never gives up. It's all part of their plan
0,LeTs LoGiN oN iNcOGnItO I cAnT bE tRaCkEd RigHt. I'm pretty sure that's common sense but maybe that's just me who knows.
1,Does this maybe mean anything for apple computers too If they potentially let eGPUs work on M1 
0,At least the hackers left up the emergency services. Big improvement on shutting down 911 like a bunch of murderous idiots
0,Love colten. Plz give more of him
0,I see. You are a CMDR of culture.
0,Try intel hd grafics that's performance
1,What nvidia needs to make right now is more gpus its like ignoring the crisys and comes up with new shit like nothing is happening
0,I FREAKING LOVE YOU ANTHONY 
0,Im am utterly offended by the incorrect db reference.
0,That intro was pure epic. Your guys are so funny.
0,me to my gt 710: i'm sorry little one 
0,Gigabyte could offer them some power supplies.
0,AIOs still have not figured out they have to measure the water temperature 
0,Apple going back to arm has to purely to stop hackintosh. When they were arm only before apple had total control over there hardware and software so when they swapped to intel they lost that ability
0,Whooo Can't wait for looking at ads that I paid a subscription for. Hurrah to Netflix 
0,Highlights in this video: Madisons style and Rileys Aussie accent from an Aussie 
0,its manbearpig dont u watch southpark :D
0, 500 for Apple Glasses is quite a good price it might seem expensive but normal frames already can cost half that much without being anything special.
0,Zen 2 is good but for gaming Intel is simply better. Emulation too. This is a fact. Coffee Lake at 5 GHz or more simply beats Zen 2 in pretty much all games especially when CPU bound as in high fps . Sadly Ryzen still does not support nested virturlization which sucks for people using homelabs etc.
0, Microsoft is finally getting into the vr market Windows mixed Reality exists you guys did a video on it.
0,Can someone compare the Xbox specs to pc specs 
1,10:14 Caught you guys You are getting paid by Nvidia aren't you 
0,Linus' name for the.segment after the ads has basically turned into a snappier version of Paul Miller's segment on the Vergecast.
1,AMD Nvidia in mining 
0,Such a disappointment I'll reconsider next time before buying AMD. Now I truly wish I bought Intel back in 2017 especially since a 7700K with liquid metal is still comparable to current high end RYZEN parts in gaming . Motherboard vendors can just remove support for older CPU's in the BIOS to free up space they removed Bristol Ridge support to provide Zen2 support on my X370 motherboard . They also provided PCIe gen4 support until AMD took that away. So they supported 3 generations now which is only one more than Intel often does. Big f cking deal. At least with Intel you know it won't have very long upgradeability so you don't expect it.
0,My Name is Taran van hermit would u like to know about my keyboard shortcuts
0,Oh my god Riley doing a surferbro voice is actually hilarious
0,what the fuck is the switch then
0,YouTube is all about Ads Your videos are just the host the Ads will attach to and eventually will suck all the goodness out

0,Jesus Christ Madison. Holy fuck. The aggression was unexpected but welcome. Is that camera okay though 
0,Robots LOVE Metal \ lol
0,Madison is a natural. She deserves this job for good.
0,Google doesn't take anything seriously.
1,0:47 30 45 fps 1080p this is defenitely not for gaming market. But at a competitive price it could be enough for less requiring users
0,WHY DOES EVERYONE AT LTT ALL ACT LIKE THEY SLOB ON KNOB FOR A LIVING 
0,Bible say do good and run from bad.
0,I think Intel made it all up so they can sell us the new cores that don't have any security issues because their lazy and can't figure out how to make the cores faster and cheeper.
0,linus with a beard is making me uncomfortable
0,tiktok getting banned YES PLEASE
1,Someone didn't check their research. The card crashes can be fixed with a software update. The cards clock speeds need to be reduced sadly because those cards used cheaper capacitors. If your going to spend the money anyways get the higher end models. Or just do the research post launch.
1,3090 super: Don't you guys have fusion reactors

0,Glad I don't need the app store to get apps.
0,Is there any real evidence of Huawei hacking I think not otherwise it would be declassified and put in every single news platform around the world. As to the Apple battery thing I hope Apple gets sued over that nonsense and fined billions.
0,Microsoft needs to drop their data collection schemes. Then a lot of users would switch back.
0,I felt personnaly attacked in the first 10 seconds. lul

0,Wow getting everyone to buy in to a Ponzi scheme must be really great for revitalising the El Salvador economy
0,My ear drums got annihilated in the intro
0,The storing crysis 3 part reminds me of using my AGP Radeon 9000 with 128MB RAM as swap partition in linux ; A nice cheap way of getting some additional fast RAM when the system was so old it was turned into a server. HDD swapping was just. horrible back then
0,will my b450 motherboard miss some features on the ryzen 5 
0,MAZ DUH. God damnit its MA ZDUH
0,Alchemy: the science of understanding deconstructing and reconstructing matter. However it is not an all powerful art. It is impossible to create something out of nothing. If one wishes to obtain something something of equal value must be given. This is the law of equivalent exchange; the basis of all alchemy. In accordance to this law there is a taboo among alchemists. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden. For what could equal the value of a human soul 
0,Wtf is up with the saturation
0,You really too to understand hydrogen powered electric vehicles C'mon Linus.
0,People getting stabbed for playstations out there Wow it's like 2006 all over again. I saw this coming from a mile away. History tends to repeat itself.
0,warframe is destiny except unlike destiny they hired game developers and not marketers disguised as game developers
0,Am i the only one that caught the number of comments at 00:10 
0,Speaking as a flat earther I can safely say that this is not a technology that will see the light of day and you can take my word for it. I also find it funny that proponents of the globe earth theory will never actually take the time to look into the evidence for themselves. All you do is watch a hit piece on the discovery channel or an interview from some astro not at NASA and claim to be an expert on the subject. I have no problem with people mocking the flat earth theory because it will just make you look that much dumber when the truth is revealed. The truth is most of you instinctively know that the earth is flat yet you'll never be willing to accept the truth because you're either hardened atheists or obsessed with science fiction Star Wars video games etc . Feel free to be ignorant but the truth is out there for anyone who is willing to research the subject with an open mind. Stop bowing down to the idols of this fallen world.

The design specifications for the aforementioned next generation network are due to be completed by April 2020 for submission to the ITU So by definition 5G does not exist but besides that I have not seen any devices equipment that provide all of the capabilities defined in IMT 2020 Basically 5G is a buzz word thrown around by the marketing teams of telecommunications equipment manufacturers but for some reason the tech press keeps eating it up and reporting on it instead of calling bullshit

Instead make games to cater to certain fans: Classic Adventure and Modern.
0,Okay I have to ask. Am I in the minority when I say that I find Riley extremely annoying Everything he says comes across as if he is saying it sarcastically like a real life Comic Book Store guide. Also the whole shouting things from off camera is dumb and the jokes dont really land for me. But I am curious as to whether I am in the minority and whether the majority like him or arent bothered by him

1,while this is bullshit I agree and a failure to maintain capacitor spec this crash only happens at VERY HIGH clock speeds. way beyond base clock way beyond boost clock and way beyond the factory overclocked guaranteed clock you are paying for. NOWHERE does ANYONE guarantee pay for or say a 3080 or 3090 should be able to do anything close to 2000 MHZ you should be thrilled to be getting 1800 MHZ and it's totally stable at that insane clock speed Yes my 2080 Ti does 1950 Mhz with no issues however that's only because I did absolutely everything right and pushed everything to the limit Except voltage.

0,Linus buddy you have clearly never seen the wikia page listing force powers. I'm pretty sure there are a few powers on record that can create black holes. There is a technique for manipulating matter at the cellular level which I think is called the Art of the Small. Do you have any idea what the Sith got up to with their alchemy The force has been ridiculous for a long time now. But I agree that a movie where the viewer can't bring themselves to believe that something could go wrong might be a bit dull. I should probably note that I haven't seen the movie in question.

0,Tbh administrating Chromebooks is legit 99x easier than Microsoft windows and Mac OS. For management especially for stolen devices as when it gets connected to the internet it auto enrols and they can't use it for anything other than work. Also you can put on restrictions that work at both home and at school work. And the whole misconception that most other tech's have about them only having gsuite and nothing more you can install any playstore app on it and any chrome webstore app. As for preps that can't login they can setup a 4 digit pin to login and bam just as easy as an iPad and kids that are Infront of others aren't limited by shitty iPads and can learn to type faster.

0,So glad Riley is at LMG.
0,5:45 that's how half The population feel already with deplatforming being a thing
0,Legally how can Blizzard Activision etc prevent you from playing games via Geforce Now If it only facilitates letting you play games you already have then this is a legal problem for them. When you buy a game despite the false advertising you are actually purchasing a license. That license gives you the right to play the game. It does NOT restrict the means in which you play the game. If they were selling you a copy of the game like how movie publishers sell you a copy of a movie or similar it would be different but since they insist on only selling you a license to play the game which they do because it deprives you of all ownership rights and doesn't obligate them to provide you with anything whatsoever I do not see how they can legally take games off Geforce Now. Creating an app like they released in China wouldn't be too difficult. It would just record your movements then when someone at a hospital gets diagnosed with the virus it could track that persons location backwards in time and notify other people that had been very nearby them in the past few days. They could just push a path representing that persons movements to each persons phone and their phone checks to see if their own history path intersects with the infected persons. When you're willing to be aggressively spied upon there can actually be beneficial uses to all that data. The downsides just vastly outweigh those few benefits.

1,I dont get why this is being dissed. I struggled for ages trying to find the cheapest possible card with a display port 1.4 output for my media PC and eventually found a RX 550 2 Gb for 53. I would have rather had an Nvidia one as I use a G Sync monitor but the GT 1030 was 70 without Display Port output. Assuming that this GT 1010 also includes a Display Port 1.4 output it has a market for non gaming PCs. Still rocking a Pentium G4560 with 8 Gb ram and a 2Gb RX 550 for my backup PC and surprisingly it even runs Baldurs Gate 3 on medium settings 720p at 30 FPS.
0,Why are users angry that they can't use a brand spanking new CPU not even released not be able to be used in their motherboards. On the AM4 socket there are so many generations of AMD CPUs that still can work for them. They have created this socket many years ago and there are some limitations that might affect you from using some of the higher end CPUs. Intel's sockets only last 2 years usually . AMD also offered better value. For the people complaining fk off 
0,Conspiracy theory: Valve manufactured COVID 19 to give everyone time to play Half Life: Alyx. Think about it. The most requested and waited for game in video game history conveniently releases in the middle of a world wide quarantine.

1,Are you fucking serious i just spend last 2 days learning all nooks and cranies about how to pass through a single gpu to the windows VM on linux literally got it working 2 hours ago and now they make it easier I just hope it doesn't f up the solution i'm using right now.
0,The kinect came out way to early. It's full body motion tracking would make it absolutely perfect as a VR controller

0,I know it sounds dumb to have multiple Oculus headsets on one account but I do have a Quest 1 and the Go and I would be mad if I couldnt use those both on the same account. Granted I'm hoping I can somehow not link my Facebook account to either but it sucks because I'll probably still do it at the deadline. Also can I just say Alex has gotten MILES better at reading from the teleprompter. I remember when he first started doing techlinked and he is amazing at it now.
0,High frequency sound simulation : 0:05
0,i love we moved from Smart Access Memory to Resizable Bar Support 
1,Nvidia CMP mining GPUs are basically trash. The MH is half what a new gpu will do at the exact same Wattage. So it actually makes MORE sense to buy the crippled gpu because it might actually have slightly better efficiency. The only saving grace would be if they aggressively price these cards wayyyy below the price of newer or even older cards. But it's Nvidia so you know it's gonna be stupid expensive.
0,that beard looks very nice.

0,I got a Linus Pulseway ad right before the video.
0,Riley is by far the best host on techquickies 
1,By inventing cryptocurrency we basically invented a way to create money by wasting electricity. This already F ed up graphics cards market now it's moving towards F ing up HDD and SSD market. Looking at the trend it will at some point F up the electronics chip market by adding to chip shortages those ASIC have to come from somewhere and have potential to F up the electric energy markets in many countries and by that virtue also potential to F up alternative energy sources markets in said countries. So lets burn more energy and F up our economy more to earn more virtual money to afford stuff that got more expensive because we burned so many energy and F ed up economy. Seems like good idea to me : 
1,Man If only I could actually buy a graphics card
0,So is Linus now playing Spot the tattoo 
0,Brilliant Ad saturation on YouTube must be making me a little smarter
0,Can't we all just agree to ruthlessly mock any company that uses quantum leap in their advertising and pr releases For those that wonder why a quantum leap is the smallest possible movement originally the distance between electron shells orbits of the atom . So for anyone using quantum leap do point out that they just said a change so small it can only be measured on a sub atomic scale . Also a quantum is heavily dependant on industry field in math it is within a boundry in latin it simply means quantity and in physics it meant a quanta of light or a quanta of electricity so a single photon . So it is a phrase that either says we specifically used this phrase since it seemed cool and we don't care about tech or we can't tell any changes can you or it was some change and we can't be bothered to specify or hey it actually emitted light technically speaking running a LED is setting up a continous set of quantum leaps 
0,did riley coordinate his shit to his mustache mustache dye ltttechstoredotcom ; P such a fun person. 3

0,TechLinked is getting an onlyfans account we live in an exciting timeline.
0,why do we have warranty or pay a company for repairs. I paid you to give me a product that shouldn't break and if it does then it is your responsibility to fix it for me because you decided to cheap out on it. why should i pay someone to fix something that they decided to not make durable and pay to have a privilege of getting it free the DIY repair shops exist because the companies that buy it aren't liable to fix it. i believe we should make companies pay for the damage that ok might be caused by us but because it wasn't durable enough. I bloody paid a 1000 to have have something that breaks when it accidentally slips out of my hand. Companies should be liable if break the screen. stop polluting the environment or making the terms and conditions so bloody long that i decide to ignore it.

He seems to know nothing about the history of topics the show has covered and again doesn't even seem to follow tech. It's actually kind of rude to put a host on like that. On a show like this that is.

1,Rumored Leaked Prices USD : 3060: 399 3070: 599 3080: 800 3090: 1300 RIDICULOUS. If this is true way to go and kill budget pc gaming Nvidia. An entry level card or a medium spec card should never cost more than a basic entry console or a high performance console. This is gonna turn a lot of entry level PC builders towards the new high performance consoles and keep a lot of current pc builders from upgrading for a while simply because its no longer going to be cost effective to build a pc rather than buy a console. GG Nvidia.

0,Ohh halo will be released on my birthday now I know what I want 
0,I don't know how the globe chip shortage hasn't been fixed yet there are so many people that have been affected by it that everyone knows about it. a ton of people have been talking about it so i don't know how it hasn't been fixed yet you would think that the companies that make the chips or silicon would ramp up production more to meet demand.

0,Tarren ordered a Stream deck XL asap right RIGHT bet the master editor did as he damn should

0,Apple does not need your privacy Peple:lets buy an iphone Apple:Iphone 10r cost 700 dollars People:screw apple Lets go and buy google pixel 3a.why should we care about our privacy.
1,Don't buy they f cked up the prices of gpu and now they selling their used gpu that maybe over used in mining for a price that still higher than the msrp.
0,Remember Snowden saying that it was illegal for the NSA to spy on Americans so they would just give their software to other countries and tell them to do it instead Yeah why even bother with other countries when you can get corporation to do it for free. As if this is noble in even the most corrupted definition of the word. Just look at how they are treating the one six Tour De Capitol Hill participants who freely gives information.

0,I wanted to buy one at my local online store but. It sold me a Ryzen 5 3400g for 586.79 
0,Like magic the schwartz can do whatever someone who uses it can develop and master. space balls reference there for the ignorant . Developing and mastering new skills takes luck in recognizing the possibility more luck in not dying from using a new application blindly and lots of practice time decades if not longer . Since most sentient beings are frail mortals it is amazing that any magic or schwartz skills are developed at all.
0,This episode taste like chicken 
0,The Meme's are strong with this one

0,I guess Linus is still upset over his iMac Pro.
0,SICK of overclocking I've hooked up several car batteries to my motherboard. Nothing
1,that's why I always set a frame limit in the Nvidia Control pannel and set it to 2X my monitors frame rate so I can have all the frames but never get coil wine by running a main menu at 3000 FPS

0,Reasons I watch this channel. The tech news Maybe sorta kinda The banter Definitely yes.
0,ahhh this is her job and to talk shit to linus
0,4:51 Xbox needs to join Playstation on this move. This won't only help console players but will provide a much better experience for crossplay games. It's illogical not to at this point besides pushing their own proprietary services. Get with the times corpo's 
0,Welcome back normal tech news last one sucked
0, 6ft instead of a 10ft cable based on community feedback That community must be completely and utterly sucking balls. I don't know a single person who'd ever want a shorter cable but I know lots who have extensions plugged because those 6ft cables are always too short.
0,Anthony is a machine 
0,Is it just me or is there some tension in this video 
1,Hoping sponsor Honey does not recommend Kwest when looking for GPUs Oof
0,I'd like to point out Tech link for the UK is uploaded at 6am on a Tuesday Thursday and Saturday. I just found it funny is all that it still lists the upload date as the 14th when it only uploaded 20 minutes ago for me.
0,I dont really care if Epyc is winning. Its not a consumer cpu and doesnt affect me at all. Im not gonna be slotting an Epyc into my practical pc. Just like Xeon doesnt affect me. And yes you come across as a major fanboy.

0,Bing is my default search engine LOL.
0,The switch doesn't have a disc drive. Lol

0,Aww i let the news go a bit stale im so late
0,more singing more clocks less close ups. ouch my eyes 
1,Finally a card to get 15fps with integrated graphics
1,Intel has been supporting resizable BAR since Haswell. It's just no board manufacturers wants to implement it.So it's basically AMD imitates intel's thing not intel steals AMD's.
1,Shits on EVGA the one card that was held back from public sale to fix the issue. and was transparent about the issue.
0,Linus. You can try to install lakka retroarch on you nintendo switch. Then you can play n64 and other retro games on you switch. Undetectable.

1,But amd understands and is supportive
0,2018's called they want their processors back
0,well was intrested in that Sega console. But if they did remove Sonic 3 because of MJ then they can screw off because clearly they haven't looked at the lies told about him by those 3 people. and made a 1 sided hit piece with proven lies and problems alllll over the place with timing
0,Last time: Navi This year: Big Navi Next year: Huge Navi Next to next year: OMEGA Navi .and the list goes on

0,That ending part its pure gold
0,A100 Raspberry Pi crysis 140 FPS
1,Seize the means of gpu production 
0,The juicer joke is fine for Linus but Anthony is too smart for that. Please do better.
0,Well now it's a competition. Is Madison or Riley better at tech news. She is so good tho

1,Is it just me or is it like 10th time that lmg made another amd won video 
0,I say this every time but damn I love this show.
0,Why would scanning phones even be a noble goal We'd better tackle the source not the symptoms. Reducing our reliance on China would have a bigger impact on the suckiest parts of humanity than scanning 1st world phones. We prop up China's economy and they cultivate a sucky North Korea and all the travesty that happens to North Korean expats in China. we're partly responsible just by keeping our eyes closed to it all.
1,Nvidia will patch the AMD Freesync work around

0,Is Amazon gonna get sued for this 
0,Isn't she the girl in asus rog or intel build your pc giveaway and stuff Epic
0,Is this EA's redemption arc Damn those game without microtransactions though
0,The CIA has a backdoor into iPhones. This past decade has been filled with news stories about Google and Amazon spying on their smart home users without consent. I don't see the difference between the US spying on us and China spying on us at this point.
0,RILEY WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT 
0, 5:50 Russian Arnold Schwarzenegger :D
0,What about the 4g next to LTE Every carrier world wide must think they can get away with claiming their LTE networks are true 4g.its all the same

0,In India 476 dollars for series S which is about 35000 rupees
0,Google really likes to ignore or abuse copyright public domain and fair use when it benefits them but heaven forbid they ever permit YOU to use anything under a copyright under fair use terms or let anything fall or remain in the public domain. Oh Google YouTube will be all over you then If not Google then some copyright troll abusing content ID to claim monetization off of false positives. Seriously Google Seriously YouTube. Screw you

0,Really had to get in a your mom joke. Didn't ya.
0,No iPadOS is nothing compared to desktop operating systems. iPads are not ready to replace conventional computers.
1,They can't even make their normal cards so I won't believe that any ti will be out before 2022
0,Dang ole I woke up and thought I was in a call of duty storyline
1,Hmmm that nVidia drawing thing might be useful for people who do fanart. Instead of finding royalty free backgrounds or spending forever making your own you can just bash something simple out in paint then run it through that for a unique background image.
0,The word you were looking for was GIF as in gift not that peanut butter sounding word. S'ok mistakes happen.
0,I like how Lisa Su takes her strap on and banging Jensen without lubercation. She is really hot on the last month.
0,I have wondered for a while now. Who is the fella that keeps shouting stuff in the back round :P Edit: Never mind its Riley : 
0,Activision Shitzard doing something shitty again. Wow I would have never expected this 
0,Honey sells your data. If its free then it means they are making money other ways

0,Oh a new face to gimme that sweet sweet tech news.
0,Riley's had a haircut and a shave. I don't like it. Glue it back on please
0,Changing the socket or chipset requirements was going to happen at some point. AMD kept going with the same socket for a lot longer than Intel has been doing. Making CPUs endlessly backwards compatible hampers their ability to continue improving. I accepted a number of years ago that whenever I upgrade my CPU I will need a motherboard upgrade at the same time
0,maybe I will ve able to import python code into pythonista on my ipad without using loopholes in the future. You know like ANY other platform

0,i feel tht vybe thing was more so cuz of there bs sex rules and not cuz of the pandemic. for real tht isnt a win cause u can literally do the same thing on every other platform
0,i really want that dennis tshirt
0,Ah Fuck Nintendo every time. Pretending they lost money on shit they don't sell anymore and never will again abusing the copyrightsystem they themselves made such a joke. It was about promoting innovation by allowing artists to make money from their works for 10 years then everything becoming public domain. But no. At least life of author 70 years so corporations can stifle innovation and clutch their gold harder than Smaug ever did. Fuck all of them
1,I literally just bought a rtx 2060. I guess I shouldnt have
0,linus cant be the only guy we see.
1,I'm just waiting for AMD to dominate on the gaming productivity laptop market so I could switch over. My desktop days are long gone because of the constant need to be on the go.

0,if u say first i will break ur kneecaps
0,Im a simple man I see Anthony and i click and like the video.
0,XPeng has officially produced the dumbest business idea since WeWork.
0,By far one of the best techlinked episodes
0,I will always be suspicious if Linus was deepfaked into a video.
0,I feel like Linus has started using the word 'butt' in his variation of 'quickbits' much more as time goes on
0,Ja you put ze electric charger hea yes 
0, Intel's ENTIRE product line is basically OBSOLETE at this point. Anthony 2019 
0,why fix something that isnt broken. fck 5g. first bring global connectivety with at least 3g. i know enough places that dont even have 3g

0,Watching this channel makes me more hopeful about humanity thanks Riley
1,THE RTX 3090 COMETH my wallet: IM OUTETH
0,Imagine if Linus actually had the voice a man sex
1,Please do a video on a blacked out high performance gaming productivity pc. I am looking to build a 5900x 64gig ddr4 3080ti system. I need it to be non rgb preferably not super loud but noise isn't as big an issue but still with thermal performance to be overclocked as I tend to hold onto pc's for a few years so overclocking helps it stay relevant a bit longer. Why no RGB I will mainly be on it during the night both for work and for gaming and unfortunately the place I live in and can't move from due to family health concerns means that the lights annoy my wife as she tries to sleep.
0,I'd love it if those drones got deployed for real. Imagine ordering anything online and having it at your door in under and hour 
0,Linus is really excited with his new looks
0, Throwing a literal bone The misuse of literal makes me figuratively roll my eyes.
1,Me an Australian: i laugh at the 70 30 series gpus still sitting on the shelf
0,Like when has sony ever agreed to cross platform multiplayer
0,Volkskrant is a msm paper. Propaganda mostly. And stories about Russia and China are mostly fake. They say this kind of things to ride on the anti Russia and China bandwagon. Europe can't handle it just like America. Thst Russia and China do it better then the West.
0,Anthony you need a vacation bro
0,DAMN I was actually just going to check my phone as I hit play. Riley you got me bad.
0,2:23 . did he say Alt Right lens

0,I was here early for once despite Youtube Doing me a favour and taking techlinked out of my subscriptions. very cool
0,I see people throwing CP around but it's not just CP; it's child abuse. It could be a picture of a kid on fire or much less extreme a video of a kid crying in a corner etc. Now I'm not convinced this initiative is actually a good thing because: slippery slope. I just think people should stop using CP and consider the broader application which can also be a downside since they're looking for a broader range of content thus could hit more false positives .
0,It's okay I will use my 3900x as a server and a buy a new motherboard and cpu and toss out my Intel cpu
1,I knew about the frys electronics because theres one near Duluth Georgia. The business took over what used to be a grocery store. When I went in there all there literally was just a bunch of random electronics and like 1 GPU
0,Love that she made the cut love her So Canadian minnesotan here being jelly
0,Playstation and nintendo used to work together

0,Is it just me or does anyone else find claims like China's quantum claim to be entertaining For one who's gonna live long enough to see the difference. On one level. I can see the theory based on mathematical calculations. Real world. what technology last decades let alone 600 million years beside the fact of someone living that long Even with emulation I can't fathom old consoles or computer like Atari Nintendo Commodore 64 and many others still being used 600 million years from now. Let alone todays consoles and computer systems. I guess this 'argument' also goes for any claim that involves millions or billions of years. Sure there could be points that support the claim as well as points that don't support the claim. Again who's gonna live long enough to really know. The reason I find it entertaining more than scientific is because it sounds like a gimmick for your BS for the reasons I've stated.

1,i have had really small buggs and glitches on my Cyberpunk 2070 PC. everything updated i play on ultra without raytracing tough. on a 1070 this is for me quite odd xD and loading the save takes 7 seconds :O the only bugs i have seen are some flickering never any tearing or structures that is slow loading some occasional slipups with npcs that falls trough trash cans or what ever. the only irritating one is the specs. sometimes when i find them they don't unlock. other than that it almost feels like my pc was made for cyberpunk 2077.

1,I was hoping to hear that AMD was releasing a competitor to the GTX 1080ti but it sounds like that's not happening. I am rather curious to see when AMD will release some truly new GPUs. Maybe they could focus more on 4K instead or Ray Tracing like NVIDIA is doing. That could certainly work to their advantage especially since the RTX GPUs don't really have software to support Ray Tracing ATM. Even more so since we don't know how well Game Developers will support it in their games. After all while the RTX 2080ti IS better than a GTX 1080ti at 4k it is NOT cost effective at the current prices. Which would be a smarter way for AMD to compete at the top end.

0,Australian internet works perfectly fine. Other countries are joining because out prime minister asked them too. This isn't a link tax news publishers which includes LMG are paid for access not on a per link basis. Google for example agreed to pay Nine 30M AUD annually to display it's content. That's across all of Google's platforms. There is legitimate reason to pay for this content. But paying isn't the key most important part of the legislation. The key is that these platforms have to notify all registered media organisations of a change to their algorithm in detail including how to best exploit the algorithm no less than 28 days before that change is made. That is legitimate news goes to the top of the platform. Misinformation doesn't get as much traction and is quickly debunked by the legitimate news that is at the top. Democracy that's what this is about.
0,Woah a female. So cringe keep simping she won't ever acknowledge your existence.
1,Some gas companies around me utilize encrypted EMV however it's not exclusive to per brand and I don't think it was a requirement more so to regulate the prices more effectively. See the ones that upgraded to it have to verify the card with an zip code which it then utilizes to charge you the suggested gas in that region. Say if it's US 3.10 for 93 in my region but it's US 2.88 at my work for premium I'd then be charged for 3.10 specifically because the sister company 'in that zip code' has higher priced gas thus allowing for more profit. Ultimately I wish this practice was illegal but it's not.

0,your buddy JAYZTWOCENTS was talking about it. there are a many causes that will kill a RTX3090 ranging from using the wrong power supply. if too weak using a 400W power supply. so can save a lot of money. or using a none trusted power supply CORSAIR it will create its own power surge killing every part in the PC. I gone though 5 AX1200i that done just that . I went to BEST BUY a customer have a CORSAIR power supply. he had a power surge like me. he think its its power line. I am on the same power grid as he is. its the power supply that done it. Then there are motherboards that cannot handle the load . your chokes are not enough. that 5 1 chokes or the 4 1 chokes those motherboards are so cheap. using those dirt cheap motherboard using the least and worst chokes can kill your PC. then there are people that over clock a CPU and a RTTX 3090 with out knowing what they are doing . I play smart. I do not know how to over clock. that is fine. DO NOT DO OVER CLOCK. and then there is AMAZON doing what the6y do best making video games that will kills peoples PC AMAZON is not our buddy there is a lot of blame to go around AMAZON is our enemy and there are people that will break there own PC and put the blame to AMAZON so they can get browneeee points on there TWITTER account. in other words fake news tthe solution is simple say away from the black market AMAZON and CORSAIR and ASUS then all of us will ne fine. very simple

1,LOL. that's cute 8k xbone. sigh .EVERY generation of the xbox since 360 bragged about being able to game at specific resolution and then reality hit. It's NEVER that resolution. xbox 360 claimed HD rez gaming. reality 360p or 480p at best and that still depending on the game dev and if he programmed the game TO support that resolution and still most often 30 fps xbone claimed full hd gaming. reality most often still 480 or 720p and when it was 720p it was FALSELY SCALED to that and still dependent on if the game dev built the game to support that rez.still most often at 30 fps xbone x The key detail of course is that the Xbox One X and earlier Xbox One consoles will all be able to play the same games. But titles that are X optimized will be able to take full advantage of the One X's 4K resolution. Yes the One S is capable of 4K and HDR output for videos and 4K Blu rays but only HDR for games. quote https: www.cnet.com news xbox one x vs ps4 pro .reality AGAIN.at the mercy of game devs who over 90% of the time developed built the damn games. this time FINALLY at real full hd 1080p with some games falsely scaled to 1440p resolution.and STILL many games gimped at 30fps facepalm Meanwhile the PCMR has BEEN able to do all of these things.at HIGHER fps in most games at least 2 year or more BEFORE the damn newest next gen conslow even launched. I've said it many times and I'll state it again. There are MANY reasons why it is called the PC MASTER race and not the conslow copies pc years later race. The damn video games are BUILT.USING.the PC. It is asinine to keep pouring resources into a dead end market dead in involving the context of real value across the board and not just gimped gaming and a GIMPED monetarily sandpitted.market of gaming experience . The conslow has BEEN trying to BECOME the PC for now more than 15 years since at least the first gen sony playstation btw . And yet it STILL cannot do the following: 1. Game at true UHD and 4k.as well as in greater than 30.let alone the 60 fps that the PCMR has been able to do for the past 2 years since the launching of gtx 1080 1080ti and even the 1070 with most even demanding AAA titles with a few settings dialed back a little. 2. rip Transcode shrink movies 3. Edit documents pictures music and video 4. Enjoyed a COMPLETE not gimped internet usage experience email web browsing downloading anything from anywhere and also using torrenting software testing other operating systems be it native or using a VM etc. 5. The ability to TRULY repair components as well as upgrade every component in the system.when we want and sometimes even how we want small form factor build pc's with pci flexible riser cards.nice invention for example and thus NOT to have HOPE microshit or phony aka sony will fix our machine we paid for if it has a stupid critical functionality bug like the damn ring of death on the 360's sony had a bug or two as crimpling for a while also 6. The ability to play ALL classic games dating back to even the 1980's nintendo era and snes to gensis and dreamcast n64 gamecube and wii xbox 360 and even xbone as well as playstation gen's 1 2 3.some say even the 4th gen via emultion some specific arcade games via the MAME emulator Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator to play games like Virtual Fighter from the Win 95 and 98 days. What classic games that didn't work natively for win 7 or newer windows operation systems.VM's allowed to use of such as Madden 2003 versus Windows 8.1 and newer shrugs shoulders . Thus across any or all of these options.even exclusive titles such as Zelda Metroid Ninja Gaiden Gran Turismo DIDN'T and CANNOT stop the PCMR from being able to enjoy them without the stupid expense of having to buy every conslow to play each exclusive title. 7. Mods god modes level editing etc in games: The PCMR is the ONLY place to be able to do all of these 100%. Doom games of all generations are just a few of these examples versus their conslow adaptations. I could go on with at least 3 more examples of useful things that the PCMR can do that conslows can't or best case CAN'T do well worth a shit but hopefully you get the point. Facts don't care about your feelings. The ONLY reason to buy a conslow is just for nostalgia and exclusive titles in which THAT version of the conslow DOESN'T yet have an emulator for available. Even game menu and level loading times have become MUCH.MUCH.slower over the decades and you're STILL having to download things like updates and in game content .JUST like a PC game depending on the game. So that advantage of speed of jumping right into game is basically dead from years ago verus the days of NES Genesis and SNES and even then depending on the game Mortal Kombat 1 for example there were credit screens to wait through. Stop giving your money to the conslow world. Among Steam Gog now linux is really taking off in terms of gaming capabilities and Lutris there is simply no excuse to buy a conslow UNLESS the exclusive game or two that you absolutely must have doesn't have an emulator for it. It's that simple. Chris Titus Tech Level1Techs forums Hell. ask me.sincerely and I try to help. I've been slowly migrating to Linux for a big chunk of time and it's almost there for me I'm picky. I'm hoping some of my origin games will finally start working as they should. They are the ONLY ones in my AAA modern day titles that don't quite work yet as of the last time I tried about 3 months ago . All others just work.

Just a week or two ago there was an issue with Google accounts being deactivated for not being commercially viable or something that Google was trying to say about ads and money involved with the account. They have it in the terms and conditions now. This means that if you use your new right in Cali to opt out of Google collecting and selling your info there is potential for Google to just deactivate your account for not being viable in whatever ways Google wants your account to be. It's kinda like blackmail but hey if you agreed to the T&C what can you do

0,You should not be able to patent numbers.unless they patented letters along with the numbers.
0,I'd call it a Ten Ninehundred K. 
0,1:15 Insert NANI meme here Also that plaque is definitely bitch tier as Linus said. I get the need to make it less expensive as more and more channels hit that milestone but when it comes down to it the cost of a plaque like the one shown is STUPENDOUSLY cheap compared to how much money a 100k subscriber channel has earned for youtube in advertising dollars.
0,Wait doom needs an anti cheat Isn't that a single player game

0,Riley That pitiful attempt at an Irish accent was so bad it made Tom Cruise's accent in Far and Away believable Please don't do it again Keith.
0,Apple is just trying to eliminate the human factor in the fabrication. No need to pay for employees when slaves are cheaper.
1,I'm expecting the 3000 series laptops to not really bring anything to the table the 3000 series manages to get most of its performance by blowing out the power budgets that's not going to work in a laptop. We might actually see AMD get the performance crown for laptops.

0,You need to give away that jumper.jeeez LUL
0,Is that Anus's boyfriend I mean Linus Freudian slip
1,Linus Unfortunately the only real solutions to dying Wiis at the moment are either get another Wii and use the system transfer or get a Wii U and transfer to that. With the Wii U you lose gamecube support without hacking but gain basic 1080p upscaling & HDMI. Even if the Switch had a Virtual Console chances are there wouldn't be a way to transfer virtual console games from the PowerPC based consoles to the ARM based Tegra unless Nintendo wrote new emulators. At least the Wii U has off TV play for Virtual Console games and won't kill its GPU from leaving WiiConnect24 on it's just the price for one that sucks.
0,Im never tired off my tech news would i research and do work when i have a around 8 min videos to watch
0,About to be holding my blunt in muh fuckin tiny jean pocket

0,Not really. The Ryzen XT CPUs are just better binned CPUs. The best part about them is the non XT prices will drop. 100 200 MHz doesn't affect much in the daily use

And 29 450 K They are Crazy 1265 034364261168 USD Im glad you use in Vidoe name Czech Republic and not some F word Czechia how somebody our prezident Milo Zeman can use this .
0,Why make a special noctua cooler I have a better idea: use a standard PWM fan connector and use fan shroud mountings that can be used by standard pc fans. Simply make fan deshroud easier without modifying the cooler.
0,Its not the end for intel just yet. The i5 11600K is good value. Its cheaper than the Ryzen 5 5600X but has similar performance. Though there are instances in multi core scores its a bit low compared to the 5600X.
0,After the Big Tech Co's. had words in Boris's shell like Ofcom has been told to back off for now.
0,so is it worth buying a ryzen 5 3600x right now or should i wait

0,Love the video as always great delivery but it seemed like the background music stood out a bit much not sure if it was music choice or volume or its presence at all but it felt like it detracted just slightly for me.
0,Shut your mouth in the clickbait. It is ugly.
0,5:15 you should mention the iPhone's FaceID was the only one that recognized the fake and it came out 2 years ago.

0,Madison is taking over 
0,can this guy articulate his words i cannot understand half of what he is saying with his dry mouth
0,He has energy just wish he could speak English. :p
0,I mean. Geforce Now loses a lot of game but it still has a metric shit ton more games than stadia.
0,Great move by LMG. Most viewed Tecklinked video in 4 months 
0,Another reason to be upset at Amazon is that ever since covid hit hard this year anyone that got sick or injured on the job they fired them instantly. I am unfortunately one of those victims.
0,I got a Samsung add on this vid lmao
0,What is your dream Someday I will work with linus and make fun of him
0,I see Anthony I give it a thumbs up. I'm a simple guy
0,I hope the rumor of what Microsoft is doing with the Switch will encourage Sony to let PS Now be available on the Switch. Maybe Sony would optimize the older PlayStation titles so they run well on the Switch.
0,Not to complain but zooming in when Riley tells a joke doesn't make it funnier. Quite the opposite.
0,I love how the new segments in the video let you just easily skip ads xD
0,Anthony is such a fucking natural on TL.
0,Single ply all the way Gotta save those dollars

0,When are people ever going to realize that those cpu vulnerabilities are actually backdoors for the nsa They were put there on purpose hence going back several generations.
0,who down votes a video of tech news
0,Well. Now I know what's happening around Twitch and probably Mixer and Youtube aswell: CCP supporters might have infiltrated the major streaming companies to make utopia using woke issues in US to change their ToS that ended up banning most non leftists. All this so the brand new Trovo from china can kick in and make an easy streaming monopoly out of it while taking away internet's freedom of speech.
0,I use Edge its better than chrome lmao
0,Of course I still Love you
0,anthony sign my toe nails lol
