Where can one get that shirt?!

Salvadorans get $30 in Bitcoin for free. I have dual citizenship so I'mma check how I can get it myself
Good video
Fact: this man is overweight. It just needed to br pointed out.
"Another Finnegan fan, small world I guess."
Yes! The voice mods broke to reveal that they're all Vogons! Wait! No! Stop reading beautiful tech poetry!
"Hey bro, you got sauce above your lip."
I want RTX 4080
1Tb in iPhones and still only 5Gb free iCloud...
Edge is gold
I'm no business person but perhaps maybe Nvidia devoting some of their resources to re-releasing old cards instead of pumping more supply of new cards couldn't possibly be a good thing?   Like why waste material on remaking 2060's instead of putting them towards something like a 3060?
"Sad part is, people will actually scalp up all of the 2060s because of how bad the situation is and how desperate people are to get their hands on a card that can run games and/or mine."
Wasn't this dude skinier two weeks ago in another nvidia video?
"The litecoin thing is funny but don't pretend the same thing doesn't happen to the USD, one word from a FED chair can do just as much damage."
Love the hair change at 1.58🧑👨
Use Brave over chrome!
I liked the performance from both you all 👍🏾
"I clicked something yesterday and it for some reason opened up Internet Explorer 11 :( not edge, IE."
why 12 GB for 2060? IT is too damn weak to play 4K!!
Sometimes Jake sounds like Cleveland from Family Guy...
"god, there's no beard/mustache combo that makes jake looks like an adult, maybe it's time to give up?"
"0:20 - Maybe Nvidia is just a fan of the Barenaked Ladies: ♪ _Everything old is new again, everything under the sun,_ _when we run out of GPUs again, we take some old stock,_ _we turn back the clock, we sell them in a new box_ ♪"
1tb on iPhone but no room for a headphone jack >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"WAN show topic, apple and spacex teaming up"
Finnegan Speed and Marine
Kinda shocked didn't bring up that mixed reality video that the Carolina Panthers made.
Rather just have a 4GB 3050 Ti that would hopefully have similar performance but without needing external power. I have a living room pc that has had a 1050 for way too long. For playing most family games it’s fine but I would like to play those games in native 4K without sacrificing details.
Funny that the complaint against Crpyto is how it's manipulated... while ALL fiat currency survives only because it's constantly manipulated to appear valuable.
Anybody else get the Linus pulseway ad before the start of the video?
We do want this tech news.
"I just got a 3070 today, at MSRP, it's a miracle, gl gamers, it's possible."
jake is a better actor than linus imo haha
Is that Ed Sheeran?
Bring it
My respect for Jake just went up with the FSM shirt.
"its the mustache. they said, fuck u laduzi, we're putting him front and center now lol"
You think Microsoft makes it hard to switch browsers? You should see how many notifications Google pops up if you switch away from Chrome!
"Hell yeah, Finnegan Speed & Marine!"
RTS 2060
"I use edge all the time, not sure what's the issue."
"Firefox has been a glaring security hole since the 90s, anyone using it, is opening the FRONT door to hackers. Edge is smooth and fast if you know how to manage your computer properly. As a matter of fact, you gave a prime example of it: Firefox CRACKED windows ability to set default browser, why tf would they have to do that if they were legit? crack more things open, firefox, crack tpm 2.0 while you're at it."
0:08 English speakers  :( French speakers  :)
6:00 to 6:11   1.  Ride motorbike 2.  Edit videos 3.  Game 4.  Watch LMG content 5.  cook 6.  Read books like 1984 and Witcher books 7.  jam old schooL REAL metal be it just listening or on guitar or both 8.  Finish copying my over 9 terabytes of movies collection to my new 16TB toshiba x300 hdd 9.  Given paco the penguin some squooshes ( Level1Techs L1 stress penguin btw) 10.

Lol I just saw Linus in the pulse way ad
Love the Finnegan Speed and Marine shirt :)
"Still vibing with a gtx 1080, playing vr, and pancake games at decent framerates. The life."
Eat some vegetables bro jeez
"Btw the timestamp at 0:13 says ""rts 2060"", not rtx 2060   *It raised my hopes of a new release of gpus"
Is the new 2060 transistors going to be smaller?
"Yanno, everyone makes fun of chrome's thirst for RAM, but i had far more issue with firefox than i ever did with chrome."
God I love Firefox
"More Jake and David , pls !!!!!!"
I hope I can maybe get this rtx at a reasonable price or else probs just gonna hope for the best with intel
Does anyone still believe a word MS said? Windows 10 is the last ...................................... Cool story dude
One hundred and Sixty one-st!!!
2:12 to 2:30.  This makes me wonder ( for those who multi task this much) if while you're gaming and you wanted to export a video file using openshot or another video editor..IF Microshit Winbloat 11 will cause problems with that exporting of video..such as putting that program to  sleep' and it crashes or fails to export a WORKING output video file.    Neither result would surprise me.
"Okay, either I need to go back to a lower resolution monitor or the host need to wear a clean shirt."
"TECHLINKED: Nvidia, we don't want this! NVIDEA: You'll get it anyways"
I think I picked the worst time to build my first pc
Fun Fact: A Square is a Rectangle..... *Mind Blown*
Squares are rectangles dude...
edge is really not that bad .. at least I still have the chromium tab mute by default :)
MORE JAKE!
the in new iphone storage is as big a  my computer storage!
"The last time I was this early, GPUs were still in stock"
I want my headphone jack!
I use Edge so I can get $75 a year in Walmart gift cards from Microsoft rewards.
"Mustaches are becoming contagious on this channel. You all need to quit, Mustaches are the main way to find sexual predators. You are helping them blend in."
joke@5:10 was disgustingly ignorant
thumbs down for jake
Speak for yourselves I have a gtx 1060 still. If I can actually get a hold of this card I'll be happy with it.
why 2060? why not make more 3060
LMG's bears are just so adorkable. #chonkyangels
It will literally sell no matter we want it or not. Nviida re-releasing GT 1030 with 8 GB VRAM will not come as a surprise to this point.
"Nope, still don't like Jake even if he's fatter."
color grading of the A roll looks a bit funky on this episode?
They should have done that in the first place.
"1tb of space on the iphone, and it'll still remind you after a week of ownership to buy icloud storage because its full."
IF out of stock was a year: 2021      hopefully not 2022
"No nvidia, dont give me hope, Rtx 2060 6gb is sold 600usd in our country now, waiting for 800usd rtx 206012gb lol"
I love Spain
Bringing back 2060 is a story from Feb. Now we're just adding extra 6gb to the story lol

"wasn't just litecoin that spiked, most major cryptos had a near identically timed spike and drop. I've seen the exact same thing happen a LOT, like a dozen crypto all spike and drop within seconds of each other. Seems pretty obvious some large crypto holders (like investment firm size) do a lot of market manipulation to pump n dump on a regular basis, because they got to get their profits in before their actions eventually force crypto to be regulated by governments."
Love to see you Jackie boy!!!
I think Jake secertly wants to be Riley....
HA
"And foreground prioritization caused no problems for any use cases or applications for anyone, anywhere, the end.    At least it's only an option."
😎
Next time get a clean T shirt <3
I use Edge  its better than chrome lmao
Everything is too expensive and it's painful.
Don't use edge use Linux
"Just letting us play games on p106-100 like cards would help. But oh no! Nvidia is like fuck gamers, gimme that cash. Just imagine how shitty they are acting."
tell the lard to put on a clean shirt. fuck.
I am so glad that I have the best MSI 2070 Super. :o
The 2060 is the Skyrim and GTA of the hardware world
"2:59 Poor guy, he looks like he's about to commit suicide. Please let him speak."
"i use edge. i watched this video in edge. honestly, since it started using chromium it isn't that bad"
"Ah yes, a terabyte of storage for  ...now let's see here  10 times cost of manufacturing at minimum  Good job apple, keeping up the scalping"
That’s too much RAM. Could result in a RAM emergency.
But really the new Microsoft edge with chromium is pretty fantastic especially in the workplace.
"""Life is pain, I hate-"""
Every time I see one of Linus’ thumbnails I imagine him making that face in bed and I laugh for several minutes
"Tech news, my favorite"
"Ain't gonna lie, I'd buy a re-released Zotac 1080ti Mini 🤷‍♂️"
I’d love a $700 2060
Riley has changed
"Jake: ""Come with me and let's go have pain"" If it draws blood, it's hardware."
I use Edge. I like it except it wants to open my PDF files all the time.
Cant wait for windows 11 honestly... IDK why tho cuz I cant get it
He is a great actor XDDD love him
"I just bought a new monitor, can I order a video with dark mode?"
I guess it's time for rule 34 of tesla robot feeding you a popsicle. THANKS ALOT GUYS!

Jesus Jake.
"Don't want a 2060 lol, i want the 20gb 3080ti for $1399"
Man. Jake is such a badass. Both Microsoft AND Apple tried to take over his body and he successfully fended them off.
Good content ! Woooo
Nothing against you but maybe wear a shirt with less dirt on it next time.
"If Microsoft swallowed their pride and set Google instead of Bing as their default search engine, lots of people will be using Edge Average user downloads chrome because they don't know how to change search engines"
Firefox trolling Microsoft.
"16 bits, 32bits, 64bits, 124 bits, wait! No! Its the quick bits next😁🤤👀"
Daaaaamn jake is thiccc

Riley let himself go.
"As I'm stuck running a RX570 4gb, I'm pretty much ready to buy anything.. coming out with a 2060 is interesting if you could actually buy one."
hi
"Edge is pretty cool actually. It does suck that Microsoft is so invasive with it, though."
Nvidia is the worst.
(Off topic question) has anyone else noticed the translate button under comments?
Hello team linus 👋
"If they re-release RTX 2060, it just has to be at a reasonable entry-level price."
Hi I missed you TechLinked it has been so long since Friday.
831st view and 195th like. lesss gooo!
as long as the re-released card cost ~$250-300 USD... but nah...  might as well be a paper launch for a RTX 4050 for $1000.
Change into a clean shirt first. Jeez.
They should just make more more RTX 3060 rather than going for last gen
"Can't wait for them to bring back Gtx 970 9,5gb cards 😆😂"
