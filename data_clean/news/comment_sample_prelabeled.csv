1,I'm no business person but perhaps maybe Nvidia devoting some of their resources to re-releasing old cards instead of pumping more supply of new cards couldn't possibly be a good thing?   Like why waste material on remaking 2060's instead of putting them towards something like a 3060?
1,"Sad part is, people will actually scalp up all of the 2060s because of how bad the situation is and how desperate people are to get their hands on a card that can run games and/or mine."

1,Rather just have a 4GB 3050 Ti that would hopefully have similar performance but without needing external power. I have a living room pc that has had a 1050 for way too long. For playing most family games its fine but I would like to play those games in native 4K without sacrificing details.

1,"On the topic of 2060 re-release because 3000-series isn't available: Personaly I'm perfectly happy with a 3070 ti I bought recently. Reviewers and the internet mob might shit on the card but in the European market I was in, it's actually the best (and only viable) choice. And in terms of ""bad performance increase, not worth it"", the card still slays through everything at 1440p ultra.  Point is, it's preferable to buy a 3000 card, even one that online reviewers (who get it for free) try to bury it; as long as in your specific budget situation and market conditions it's a good deal, then you should go for it. Better having a newer card than a re-release older gen imo."

0,I feel like I'm the only person who actually uses Edge.  It hasn't been a terrible experience for me. Feature parity has been pretty on point with Chrome without all the Google tracking (how much I'm really trading off giving my Data to Microsoft instead I don't really know) But I still feel good not giving everything to the big G without having to work a little harder for it.
0,Apple and Google get (rightfully) criticized for being anticompetitive and preferring their services but no ones bats an eye that Microsoft makes it impossible to switch from Edge
0,"So instead of just telling the companies to keep the prices at a set marker, they re-release an old card in order to combat it........? Just stop."
1,"But nvidia, I DO want that! (title lol) thank you."
0,"I use Edge to read PDF files. Besides that, it's good for installing Chrome and Firefox."
0,If you used edge you'd realize that they already implemented the tab sleep mode like on windows 11 months ago. I think you may have to enable it using edge://flags but it's been there the whole time. Quit trying to use Chrome or Firefox come join us in the 2021 where these issues were resolved back in 2020.

0,A gym needs to sponsor Jake
1,"I'm not sure releasing another graphics card will ease the burden on chip fabs.  Further, while I don't think having last gen's card still available is necessarily a bad idea, it makes me wonder how it would compare to a lower-spec 30-series card.  I don't see the point of having two pieces of hardware with neck-in-neck performance, or two cards with barely distinguishable price points.  So, if the 2060 isn't _significantly_ cheaper than a 3060, then I don't see the point in a 2060; and if the 3060 isn't _significantly_ faster than a 2060, I don't see the point in a 3060.  We could probably stand to have fewer SKUs.  2060, 3060, 3070, 3080, 3080Ti, 3090 ... that's too many cards.  Let's pare this down to prices and performance points that make sense, and clear up some space in the manufacturing and retail channels so that they're actually obtainable."

0,"""Hey Jake... got a clean shirt for the shoot? Naw......"""
1,if they want to re-release a card nvidia could release enmass 1650's because there is nothing in that segment and we are drowning down here
0,"Ive been using edge at my work and school and its actually really good. Better than stock chrome imo.  Like, I can alt tab through tabs instead of all my tabs in chrome showing up as a single window.  Also bing is actually giving me better results than google now too..   Sorry not sorry microsoft has actually done something right here."
0,fresh T-Shirt next time?
0,"I'm all for consumer choice, but as someone that's used every browser ever made, as of this moment (and it's been this way for a long while) Edge is the vastly superior browser. And I say that with zero hyperbole or sarcasm. While I agree the change to altering default apps is rather stupid by Microsoft, Google Chrome is a shadow of it's former self and has been for many years, and Firefox is a buggy, incompatible joke. I have had less problems with Internet Explorer over the years than I have with Firefox. Some of the lesser known browsers like Vivaldi and such showed great promise, but ultimately are unusable in their current states."
0,"Imagine manufacturers using smaller batteries to cut costs because of the better efficiency, so we end up with a shitty battery and get the excuse of ""oh it's so light and costs less"", which in the end just means they cheaped out"
1,i want it for Rs 20000 or less ;) no more tho also 12 gb vram will be good for gpu rendering in blender ;)
0,"While maybe it's more work now, all browsers have had this option. It was inevitable this would get fixed since file type associations are in the Registry. Furthermore, Microsoft gives more precise control over things and you guys whine. They don't, you whine. Apple does the same thing and doesn't let you do any default apps, everyone praises Apple. Apple gets away with things that Microsoft has been sued over, and no one cares or calls them out on it. So we clearly know how the bias is driven I guess."
1,I would really want any rtx card
0,i would love to see him in asmr with amoaura
1,"If they can make the 2060 again to ""fill the gaps"" why can't they just make more of the current ones? Isn't chip supply the main bottleneck? How would this get around that?"
0,"Gee, I never read about an LJA 1700... Or Risen."
1,the re-release RTX 2060 better be below 350$

0,This was another fun one. Thanks.
0,"Is he getter bigger, looks like twice as big as when he started at LTT. Dude less food more tech. Also recommend losing the ped tash."
1,2060 doesn't have enough compute to use 12GB of VRAM.  It's a complete waste.

1,12GB sounds so overkill but then you realise it's an RTX 2060 and isn't even that great

0,"Hey Jake, how about a clean shirt next time?"
1,Why sell RTX 3080 and make 50% profit when you can sell RTX 2060 and make 75% profit.
1,"Wouldn't it be better if the re-released RTX 2060 _didn't_ have 12GB VRAM? It's a waste on a chip like that (and we're in a shortage), and with more of the board power going towards powering the VRAM chips, there would be less left over for the core. Meaning lower sustained clock speeds. At least that's usually how it works."
0,You can't just hit me with reality off the bat like that man  You just can't
0,Love the FSM shirt Jake.

1,LTT - the only channel to think GPUs are for gaming. What cunts.   Since pandemic people that need workstations are working from home and want a workstation that can game. Anyone that isn't a canadian closet reject with a mail order wife will tell you that more vram is better as that is where meshes are stored and if say... Blender for example... Runs out it starts to use slower system memory.   Fuckingg rejects.
1,"Does it actually help? The extra vram? Cause I don't think I ever hit a bottleneck of vram on my 1080ti. Both at 1080p and 1440p, vram was the least of my problems."

0,Windows 1 will run better.   right is there ANY evidence for this?  NOPE storing crap in my ram on a gaming system is actally LESS efficient as i need that ram. so it wastes cpu  cycles and causes microstutters just like windows 10 where i disabled over 100 backgroud processes and removed bload to fix it.  it will be a pile of shit just like 10 untill we mod is heavily. same goes for android which gets WORSE every single downgrade.

As much as I've been trying to live with an Intel stock cooler, I still kinda want one of those fancy Noctua NH-D9L coolers! (NH-D15 won't fit my configuration)"

1,"i may be an idiot, but could someone please explain to me how Nvidia rereleasing the 2060 will combat the GPU shortage? I'd imagine they'd still have the same amount of resources to put towards building GPUs and I'd imagine a 2060 takes pretty much as long to make as any other GPU to make, so wouldn't their GPU output be the same?"
0,Why does it look like Jake is dancing to his own inner beat during this video... or did he REALLY need a bathroom break?

0,Dirty shirt ;-)
1,"The RTX 2060 is a really good card, I like LTT but get off that ivory 3080/3090 tower, if this card is around 400 during the chip shortage it'll be a 200% win (the 6 Gb 2060 MSRP was at 360). It probably won't though, it'll be overpriced out of the gate because of the shortage but it's still a win to have anything on the shelves. It's really nice they are bringing a 300 card back with more VRAM (for higher resolution gaming, etc.) given the shortage, I just hope it lasts on shelves a bit and doesn't get scalped (we can always hope retailers vet the sales better)."
0,"Couldn't find a clean tshirt? Standards lads, standards."
1,"Won't 12 GB of GDDR6 cause a bottleneck on a 2060? The 3090 has already had issues with 24 GB of much faster GGDR6X VRAM, with all the upgraded tech it uses."
1,How hard does NVIDIA want to screw us 20xx owners??
1,"Just make more rtx 3060 not rtx 2060, the rtx 3060 is much more powerful"
0,Dude. Headphone jacks are not coming back. Make like Elsa and let it go. Let it go already.
0,we need more jake content on every ltt channel
0,edge is actually good and less ram hungry than chrome
0,As soon as saw the stach thought that we are in 80's.
1,"Uuuuh, yes, we actually DO want an RTX 2060 re-release, what the fuck you on buddy? Or do you mean the 12GB VRam part? Because THAT is GENUINELY stupid. It will just make the card more expensive for no reason. You will never be able to use so much VRam on a comparatively weak card. 6 or 8 GB of VRam would've been fine."
0,It's a pain how dirty is your shirt.
0,Get a shave you scruffy twta.
1,"If the VRAM is one of the most expensive thing in a graphics card, and they re-release a cheaper GPU with more VRAM, it won't be that cheap anymore. Anyway, do we NEED 12GB on 2060?"
1,"1700 and DDR5, mixed feelings, good direction but mixed, AMD may win tho if ddr5 hits them soon. They'll likely do AM5 with DDR5 which would make naming sense, but when do they ever make sense with numbers?"
0,"Edge is good now, at least. I like its immersive reader and PDF annotating."
1,The pain of existence combined with gpu shortage damn xD
1,Why tf would nvidia produce 2060 with 12gb ram when its already too hard to produce 3060 with 12gb of ram for a reasonable price ._. reeks like a s-class-hit
0,Oh boy! A whole week of popsicles!!!!!!!!!!
0,Tbh it would be nice to see some rx580 chips produced again. Old chips could save the entry level market
0,all the pccuckrace upgraders keep ruining it for others
1,"Why wouldn't a gpu narrow the production line, an increase the production of the higher end? I undeestand theyll become ""cheaper"" but theyll give the consumer what they actually want? Won't making 2060, if they're producing them, create more shortages across each line? Isn't the issue with the shortages about the capacitors, and dont the old card use more of them, as theyre less efficient? Dont the older ones use more silicon as they're larger dyes?"
0,Surely you can still set file associations through the Registry?
1,"Honestly, you are an idiot if you blame the Litecoin scam on the crypto community. How about some reliability on the media who don't even make a phone call before spiralling out of control?  A 20% jump on Litecoin is nothing. The vast majority of the crypto community did their research and knew it was a scam, otherwise it would have been 1000%+ increase. The ""people"" who bought it was probably just some bots auto-buying based on news."
0,Shimmy Shimmy.
0,edge is good you just have to change the default browser with google
0,"Ya know, maybe Microsoft have just got me or maybe Ive gone insane but the Chromium version of Edge isnt actually that bad,"
0,"Can confirm the Firefox default browser thing. I was expecting it to open default apps and get me to set it. But no, I just clicked Use as default browser in a Firefox popup and that was it! Good job Firefox!"
0,"you don't know how painful it is to use chrome instead of edge because for some reason, edge signs me out of all the sites i've signed in, after closing the app. i've tried so many things, but got only pain and nothing else"
1,"As much as people are iffy about the 2060 rerun, it's a way to utilize fab space that isn't in high demand right now. While it might be hopeful for people to have hoped that they would rerun the 2080 Ti, most likely there wouldn't be enough demand to justify the order (or maybe there is, miners seem to want any card that is profitable)."
1,Surely new 2060's have the same supply and build issues as the 30 series cards??

0,Jake is lookin thicc af!
1,"Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't buy a 3090, but I had to because it was only $200 off MSRP, while 3080's are usually priced double (sometimes triple) to their actual price. And I was only able to buy it because the store that it sells from is a store that is not well known for selling gaming or computer related stuff. Meaning not a lot of people are botting the website (like Amazon, Newegg, and Bestbuy), but nonetheless, the stock was gone in less than 15 secs after I got one.  Edit: yeah, 3080's, especially non LHR ones are still highly desired because at MSRP, it would only take around 3-4 months to pay its price off by crypto-mining, while 3090s will take about a year or more. This is why 3080 prices can go up to triple, and why AMD cards are cheaper is because they don't mine as well as Nvidia cards."

0,"2:30 always trashing on google chrome using  ""too much ram""... Me: opens up task manager to see how much ram is my google chrome using (watching this video + 40 tabs 4 folders 6 extensions 200+ bookmarks) for a whooping 800mb of ram usage... This is old news guys get your shit together already."
0,"Wait, I dont get it, whats wrong with Edge? Ive been using it for a long time seriously, why bother downloading something else?"
0,Does Linus not pay you well enough to wear that dirty t-shirt? What about those lttstore things that you guys keep saying in every video..give this man a clean t-shirt!

0,So what if we just *don't* upgrade to windows 11
0,I feel bad now for choosing Edge a year ago >:(

0,You know it's good when you get the camera guy to nose laugh. Good job Jake. 
0,Edge... At least it's now better than Chrome
0,that 20 tesla magnet is not something you'd probably want to spend any time standing next to
0,Microsoft Windows 11 improves performance.  It just requires 4GB of RAM minimum just to run published by Microsoft.
0,I would actually buy that card.  Still running a 1060. However! I imagine its price will be unreasonable
0,"Aaah iPhone, 1tb of storage, no expandable memory, no headphone jack, no charger for the low low price of (probably) $2000"

0,"it's official, it's a good time to build dedicated streaming rigs"
1,"Another RTX 2060 re-release? Isn't that was the ""Super"" was made for already? Why not a re-release, ""RTX 3060 Super"" instead? Oh, Nvidia, how confusing you really are. "
0,no one tell this man his shirt was dirty before they hit record?
0,"Well thanks Jake, life rn is definitely pain broke up with the gf"
1,"0:27 ""...but this time it will have 12Gb of VRAM!  Double the previous amount!"" Pretty sure my old 2060 has 16Gb.  EDIT:  I was wrong.  It's got 8Gb."
0,This dude has Donald Trump haircut?!?
1,"If they are re-releasing the 2060 do they already have a stock of chips sitting is a warehouse somewhere? If not then why reduce the already insufficient production of 30 series chips to make more. It is almost like Nvidia has their head shoved so far up their rectum that if a good idea hit them in their ass it would give them a concussion. And let's face it, they aren't fooling anyone with their, ""stab you in the back while cleaning out your wallet"", marketing approach."
0,Do everyone like to watch the tech news while shitting in bathroom ?

0,today's tech news was underwhelming
0,WHat the heck is this tech news 
1,"When you buy crypto you're essentially investing in the technology, just like investing in Intel and AMD, except it has not yet been ruined and made into a rich man's hobby by governments, yet. That's why crypto is evolving fast and will eventually replace FIAT aka blood money in the form of a stable coin of some sort. It's investing 2.0. Crypto is also an incentive mechanism for creating global networks of different devices. You can get paid in crypto for running a weather station that transmits that data through the network for anyone to see. It's literally internet 2.0. Here to stay. Cry about it if you want, or be smart and invest/participate."
0,Edge is better than Chrome .
0,My eyes are stuck on the nipple stain on that shirt
0,Jokes on you I'm already using Edge
0,Life is spain but the s is silent
1,"Why must they give the RTX 2060 12 GB of VRAM?? No one is going to be playing any game at like 8K, where 12 GB of VRAM is useful. They should have just given it higher 256-bit memory bus, which would improve performance more than 12GB of VRAM"
0,It seriously irritates me we are on iPhone 7 and the headphone Jack is still missing.
0,"I'm using edge rn, the chromium ver, it's not bad. At least the ram usage is still lower than Chrome."
0,This was a good video
0,I use edge and I love it
0,why would somebody use 1 tb on a phone??? 100gb would be enough....
0,"Edge isn't that bad, besides, why do you want to change the default browser everyday? I do it just once after a windows install and then done."
0,Love Jakes behaviour of presenting the news. MORE JAKE PLEASE ON TECLINKED.
0,I love Jake's confidence to do a Video in a stained atheism shirt. I'm surprised nobody made change into a LTT shirt.
0,"Jake, you look like you could be related to Chris Farley..."

1,12Gb will not be useful for anyone on a 2060. It does not have enough horsepower to even saturate 10Gb. 12Gb on a 2060 is literally just a waste of silicon
0,Edge is great
0,Life is sPain*
0,Use brave not edge
1,Buy a re-release gpu and watch them drop driver support soon after.

0,"I've been following the MIT fusion reactor project for a while.

0,"I miss you, Jake."

0,What's the beef with Edge? I like it and it does everything I need - and I'd say I'm a pretty average user.
0,"Windows: instead of removing all the bloat ware and freeing up processing power lets just reprogram our entire OS to put them in ""sleep mode"""
1,12GB of pain and suffering...
0,"Is Edge really that bad? It's based on Chromium, so it really shouldn't be that different from Chrome. I'd use Brave or Vivaldi before either, but I can't imagine Edge could be that much worse than Chrome."
0,"Jake should do more techlinked,, i like techlinked cake from him"
0,0:44...you just like RAM ? or ? do you just LIKE being rammed ?
1,Laptop gamers: thanks Nvidia. You SUCK!

1,Got an AMD ad before this.
0,Nice porn-stache Jake 
1,RTS 2060?
0,switch to firefox!!! its great.
1,That VRAM will be worthless for what a 2060 can push.  It's BS.
1,What video card shortage?  My local retailer has nearly every 3080 model in stock as well as 1030's.  Nothing in between though.
0,"Is it a new thing TechLinked has now to feature hosts with dirty shirts? lmao, keep it that way."
0,1:21 ohhh stop you ;)
0,edge is kind of good and light
0,lmao hes pretty good as host. i think my favorite is still james tho
0,"I switched from Chrome to Edge, and its great! Join us"
0,yes we do
0,"YouTube tech channels when a new phone is announced:   ""Better re-use headphone port joke, again""."
0,"Edge is actually awesome.  It's got workflow tools that no other browser has even thought of, which tells us they don't think all that much, unless it's about ad revenue."
0,I enjoyed your presentation Jake.
0,Can we get you a clean t-shirt?
0,Use Microsoft Edge (or else)
0,Edge is pretty good.

0,Did jake ate maddison? Havent see her in a while
0,200 is reasonable
0,Fat logan paul with moustache 
0,I already use Edge. It integrated quite well with windows features.
0,Only 15 more years until fusion power...
0,"For the record, Edge is better."
0,Edge clearly has more features . I can't understand why they hate Edge and other Microsoft products so much.
1,I do not understand VIDIA point of view. there is a CHIP SHORTAGE  to fix it put MORE CHIPS got a old out of date 2060  that only got 6GB GDDR6 then ad more CHIPS to make it 12GB the match dose not work  like 4+4+12
1,Why wouldn't they add this vram to 3050 and 3050ti?
0,Intel Shark Jumped.
0,Wheres my Riley gone?!
1,Nvidia tipping the fact that they actually don't have a shortage. I mean if there was a shortage it sure would make it hard to explain why Microcenter has stacks of AMD cards across the entire product stack they can't shift at their gouged prices.
1,"I think a LOT of people ""want"" a 2060 with 12 gb vram at this point. It's only dependent on the price. It's DX12 Ultimate ready, DLSS, ray tracing capable at 1080p/60 fps, and supports RTX IO, it's pretty much a 30 series card without the 30 series badge, except for resizable bar I guess. It's crazy how futureproof the 20 series cards were."
0,Jake you are breathing weird! Please exercise before is too late
1,RTX 2060 LHR V.2 ?
1,"If they can build those 2060s in a different fab without impacting their other products, this might be good.  However, they'll probably all be scalped for upwards of $600.  Or we'll see pictures of pallets of them going to miners directly like everything else."

0,"there is literally nothing wrong wth edge, in fact it out performs other browsers in some situations. and edge is privacy based, microsoft only makes like 7 billion in ad revenue, compared to googles 150 billion. ive used all kinds of browsers, but once i switched to edge i wont use anything else again"
0,This dude is awesome lol

0,"As for the 20T strong magnets - 20 years ago to achieve anything over 15T, single use, explosion - fueled compression magnets were needed (yes, they exploded the device to create momentary spike of magnetic flux). Solid state 20T is an insane breaktrough."

0,New Microsoft edge is better than chrome though
0,"I'm not much of a commenter, but this video requires me to say that the LMG writers receive neither the credit nor the disdain that they so rightly deserve."
1,"Wow, a 2060 with 12GB of VRAM... Uh, how is 12GB of VRAM going to matter in a card that can't actually do enough to use it all?  Maybe if they do it in a lower nanometer process like that one GPU, then it could have some potential"
0,TechLinked we don't want Jake
0,The power of the sun in the palm of my hands!
0,That intro was too real
0,"Whats up with the dirty shirt? I love me some tech linked, but distracted by the shirt"
0,Dirty shirt
1,"You know it's funny, everyone is bemoaning the fact that there's no GPUs at a decent price but when either company tries to do something to ""help"", everyone bitches about that too...  Short version, MAKE UP YOUR MINDS.  Now granted the 2060 12GB will probably be gone at launch but the short version is, most of the general population doesn't care what GPU it is.  If it lets them game, they're going to buy it."
1,lol RTS 2060
1,"they want to make gtx 2060s, but what we need is gtx 3050s"
0,"3:46 Um- are you?-- Uh... Are you alri-? Oh, I- I guess you're alright now. Did he just get possessed by Microsoft?"

0,"Bro I never eat popsicles and I just happened to be eating one when you said ""I hear popsicles are pretty nice""  GET OUT OF MY HEAD LINUS MEDIA GROUP"
0,"well i do use edge now they make it with chromium. it's good enough for me, and also eat all my ram!"
1,"Oh great, now my RTX 2060 6GB will be worth the price it was on release"
0,Is it possible this is supposed to replace 1660 Tis? Those still sell like hotcakes. These cards have Raytracing and the newer bells and whistles. That kind of thing.
1,60 series cards and below are trash. 3070 and up or AMD equivalent only if you're joining the PC Master Race.

1,I'd buy a 2060 with 12 Gigs because the memory is all that matters for mining the coins I use. So expect that to be way over priced too...
0,Get a clean shirt 
0,"Okay, everyone bashes on edge, but It's actually really good. I've been using it as my primary browser for a while after switching from chrome and I really don't have any complaints."
1,Is it possible to create a gpu thats only best for mining and one thats exclusive for gaming or is that going to lower revenues
0,0:13 Why is he moving like that
1,"Well, I definitely want a rtx 2060.  At 200 bucks or less ffs!"
0,I love his dirty shirt. You can tell this show is always last minute lol
1,"Someone fix the caption ""RTS 2060 re-release?"""
0,"Hey, Jake is wearing a Finnegan shirt"
1,"Are you guys okay?  It's not that bad! New games run fine on old hardware still, a 12gb 2060 at msrp sounds rad, and there's always cloud gaming and Linux! Plenty of tech to live for! And how about that Steam Deck, huh?"
0,there are very few reasons not to switch to edge

0,Yes.
0,"4:10 tbh, I'm getting really tired of everyone crying ""still no headphone jack"". In 8 days it'll be 4 years since Apple released the iPhone 8, without a headphone jack.

0,"Wow, getting deep and philosophical with that intro. I can relate to that intro far too much these days."
1,"China stopped bitcoin mining because of problems in their coal industry and the need to reduce electricity use.  Once they get this figured out, bitcoin mining will be allowed again.  This may be the cheapest GPU cards you will see."
